# Error Correction Workflow - Simplified Tests

This directory contains a simplified, consolidated setup for testing the error correction workflow.

## Files

- `test_master.sh` - A single, comprehensive test script that tests both ResourceType and unused variable fixes
- `test_resource_types.ts` - Test file for ResourceType fixes
- `test_unused_vars.ts` - Test file for unused variable fixes

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
cd CodeBase_Docs/changelog/Error_Correction/March17_Error_Directory/Tests/essential
chmod +x test_master.sh
./test_master.sh
```

## Why Simplified?

The original testing setup included many redundant files:

- Multiple test scripts with overlapping functionality
- Duplicate test files with \_backup and \_original suffixes
- Numerous small scripts for specific fixes

This consolidated setup provides the same test coverage with a much cleaner structure:

- One master test script that performs all tests
- Only the essential test files
- Clear, consistent organization

## Required Scripts

The tests require the following scripts to be in the `Scripts` directory:

- `analyze_typescript.sh`
- `fix_resource_types.sh`
- `fix_unused_vars.sh`
