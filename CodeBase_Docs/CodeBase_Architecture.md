## Resource Management System

### Standardized Resource Types

We've implemented a standardized type system for resources in `src/types/resources/StandardizedResourceTypes.ts` to address inconsistencies identified during code analysis.

Key improvements:

- Converted string literal resource types to TypeScript enums for better type safety
- Created a centralized metadata repository for resource information
- Implemented a ResourceStateClass with proper validation and consistent property access
- Standardized all resource flow interfaces (nodes, connections, recipes, etc.)
- Added backward compatibility for existing string-based types

Complete documentation is available in `CodeBase_Docs/CodeBase_Context/StandardizedResourceTypes_Documentation.md`

### Implementation Progress

#### ResourceFlowManager Migration

The ResourceFlowManager has been updated to use the standardized resource types:

- Removed duplicate type definitions that are now in StandardizedResourceTypes
- Updated imports to use the new type definitions
- Replaced string literals with enum values
- Added ResourceStateClass for proper state management
- Added backward compatibility for interacting with legacy code

#### UI Component Updates

The following UI components have been updated to use standardized types:

- ResourceManagementDashboard.tsx
- ResourceFlowDiagram.tsx

These components now use ResourceType enums and the ResourceTypeHelpers for type conversions and display name retrieval.

#### Migration Strategy

1. Phase 1 (Completed): Created type definitions and updated core components
2. Phase 2 (In Progress): Update remaining UI components
3. Phase 3 (Upcoming): Update context providers and hook implementations
4. Phase 4 (Upcoming): Deprecate old string-based system
