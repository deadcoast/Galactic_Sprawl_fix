## Current Implementation Tasks

<think>The user wants me to continue discussing the next focus areas that I identified at the end of my last response. Specifically, they want more details on:

1. Refactoring more context providers to use the BaseContext template
2. Implementing the Exploration System using the standardized patterns
3. Continuing the performance optimization and testing efforts

I should provide a more detailed analysis and implementation plan for each of these focus areas, drawing from the System_Architecture.md and System_Integration.md files that have been updated.</think># Next Implementation Focus Areas

Based on our updated architecture documentation and progress tracking, I'll outline a detailed approach for each of our three main focus areas moving forward:

## 1. Refactoring Context Providers to BaseContext Template

### Current Status

We've successfully created the `BaseContext` template with standardized patterns but still need to refactor several context providers to use this template:

- `GameContext` in `src/contexts/GameContext.tsx`
- `ResourceRatesContext` in `src/contexts/ResourceRatesContext.tsx`
- `ModuleContext` in `src/contexts/ModuleContext.tsx`

### Implementation Plan

#### GameContext Refactoring

```typescript
// Steps to refactor GameContext
1. Analyze existing state structure and action types
2. Define GameState interface aligned with BaseState
3. Map current reducers to standardized pattern
4. Create ManagerConfig for GameManager connection
5. Implement context selectors for performance optimization
6. Migrate event subscriptions to standardized pattern
7. Replace current implementation with createStandardContext
8. Update useGame hook to use selector pattern
```

#### ResourceRatesContext Refactoring

```typescript
// Steps to refactor ResourceRatesContext
1. Extract resource rate calculation logic
2. Define RatesState interface aligned with BaseState
3. Create action types for rate updates
4. Implement connection to ResourceManager
5. Add event subscriptions for resource changes
6. Create memoized selectors for rate access
7. Replace implementation with createStandardContext
8. Update useResourceRates hook with selector pattern
```

#### ModuleContext Refactoring

```typescript
// Steps to refactor ModuleContext
1. Analyze existing module state structure
2. Define ModuleState interface aligned with BaseState
3. Map module actions to standardized pattern
4. Create ManagerConfig for ModuleManager connection
5. Implement context selectors for module filtering
6. Update event subscriptions using standardized pattern
7. Replace implementation with createStandardContext
8. Update useModules hook with selector pattern
```

### Testing Strategy

For each refactored context provider:

1. Create comprehensive unit tests comparing behavior before and after refactoring
2. Test performance improvements with React profiler
3. Verify event subscription cleanup on unmount
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing components

## 2. Implementing the Exploration System

### Current Status

The Exploration System has been largely implemented with standardization and proper integration with our architecture:

- ✅ `ExplorationManager` now implements the `BaseManager` interface
- ✅ Added standardized event types for exploration events
- ✅ Implemented `ReconShipManagerImpl` for ship management
- ✅ Connected `DataAnalysisContext` to receive exploration events
- ✅ Implemented automatic dataset creation from discoveries
- Still needed:
  - Connect DataAnalysisSystem UI component to use the processed data
  - Implement discovery classification visualization
  - Create integration tests for the exploration system

### Implementation Plan

#### DataAnalysisSystem UI Component

```typescript
// Steps to connect DataAnalysisSystem UI
1. Refactor DataAnalysisSystem to use useDataAnalysis hook
2. Implement dataset selection interface
3. Create visualization components for different analysis types
4. Add filtering capabilities for exploration data
5. Implement real-time updates from exploration events
6. Add performance optimizations with memo and callbacks
```

#### Discovery Classification Implementation

```typescript
// Steps to implement discovery classification
1. Create ClassificationAlgorithm interface
2. Implement anomaly classification algorithms
3. Implement resource classification algorithms
4. Create visualization components for classification results
5. Add user feedback mechanism for classification accuracy
6. Implement classification confidence metrics
```

#### Integration Points

The Exploration System is connected to:

1. ResourceManager for resource potential analysis
2. UI layer through DataAnalysisContext provider and hooks
3. Event system with standard exploration events

### Testing Strategy

1. Create comprehensive integration tests for the exploration flow
2. Test discovery classification algorithms
3. Verify event propagation between systems
4. Measure performance under heavy exploration workloads

## 3. Performance Optimization and Testing

### Current Status

We've implemented basic performance monitoring in standardized managers and added memoization in context providers, but comprehensive optimization and testing are still needed.

### Performance Optimization Plan

#### Critical Path Optimization

```typescript
// Performance optimization focus areas
1. Profile ResourceFlowManager optimization algorithm
2. Implement incremental updates instead of full recalculation
3. Add caching for expensive calculations
4. Optimize event distribution with priority-based processing
5. Implement virtualization for long lists of modules/resources
6. Add time-slicing for heavy operations to prevent UI blocking
```

#### Rendering Optimization

```typescript
// React rendering optimization
1. Implement React.memo for all list components
2. Review useCallback usage in event handlers
3. Create specialized equality checks for complex props
4. Use useMemo for derived data calculations
5. Add windowing for long lists with react-window
6. Implement lazy loading for modules and resources
```

#### Event System Optimization

```typescript
// Event system performance
1. Implement event batching for high-frequency events
2. Add priority queue for event processing
3. Create event filtering to reduce unnecessary processing
4. Implement event debouncing for rapid state changes
5. Add performance monitoring for event propagation times
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Integration Testing

```typescript
// Integration test focus areas
1. Create end-to-end tests for core gameplay flows
2. Test boundary interactions between systems
3. Implement module lifecycle tests
4. Create resource flow optimization tests
5. Test exploration and discovery mechanisms
```

#### Performance Testing

```typescript
// Performance test implementations
1. Create benchmark suite for ResourceFlowManager
2. Implement rendering performance tests
3. Measure event propagation performance
4. Test module system with large numbers of modules
5. Create memory leak detection tests
6. Monitor performance metrics during gameplay
```

#### Automated Testing Pipeline

```typescript
// Automated testing approach
1. Integrate performance testing into CI pipeline
2. Add automatic detection of performance regressions
3. Create visual regression tests for UI components
4. Implement load testing for resource optimization
5. Add coverage reporting and enforcement
```
