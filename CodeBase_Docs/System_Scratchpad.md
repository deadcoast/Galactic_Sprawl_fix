### 1.2. Implementation Strategy Used

All components successfully implemented the following strategies:

2. Applied the `d3Accessors` functions for coordinate access
3. Implemented type-safe data conversion functions
4. Added proper interface extensions for D3 datum types
5. Created well-documented props interfaces with JSDoc comments

Adapter function pattern implemented across components:

```typescript
const convertNodesToD3Format = (nodes: DataNode[]): D3Node[] => {
  return nodes.map(node => {
    // Create a properly typed node with no type assertions
    const d3Node: D3Node = {
      id: node.id,
      // Other properties...
      // Store original data for reference
      data: node,
    };

    return d3Node;
  });
};
```

### 6.2. Implementation Strategy

The integration showcase will focus on demonstrating:

1. **Measurable Performance Improvements** - Side-by-side comparisons showing performance gains
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Visualizations that adapt to different device capabilities
3. **Developer Experience** - Simplified API for implementing optimized visualizations
4. **Type Safety Benefits** - Reduction in runtime errors and improved code maintainability
5. **Real-world Use Cases** - Practical examples of optimizations in common visualization scenarios

The showcase will be implemented as a multi-page application with each page focusing on a different aspect of performance optimization and type safety.
