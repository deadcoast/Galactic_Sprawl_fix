# System Scratchpad

## Tasklist

- [ ] Implementing advanced WebGL shader effects for data highlighting

- [ ] Cross-Chart Coordination: Synchronized interactions across multiple visualizations

### Dependency and Integration Issues

Several components have dependency issues, particularly with Material UI imports. These need to be resolved to ensure proper component rendering.

The front-end components and back-end services need better integration points to ensure data flows properly through the system.

While we've created type definitions, there are still inconsistencies and 'any' types that should be removed for better type safety.

## STAGE 1 DUPLICATE IDENTIFICATION PLAN

### 1. Pattern-Based Search Strategy

[ ] Common Naming Patterns

- Search for files with similar names (e.g., Base*, *Service, \*Manager)
- Look for numbered versions or suffi es (e.g., v2, Enhanced, New)
- Identify test files that may test the same functionality

[ ] Directory Structure Analysis

- Compare files across similar directories (src/lib vs src/utils)
- Look for repeated patterns in component hierarchies
- Identify parallel implementations in different modules

[ ] Implementation Patterns

- Search for common interface implementations
- Look for similar class hierarchies
- Identify repeated utility functions

### 2. Functionality-Based Search

[ ] Core Services

- Map all service implementations
- Group by primary functionality
- Identify overlapping responsibilities

[ ] Component Patterns

- List all UI components by category
- Group by visualization/interaction type
- Find components with similar props/state

[ ] Data Management

- Map data flow implementations
- Group by data type handling
- Identify redundant transformations

### 3. Systematic Code Analysis

[ ] Use grep_search for:

- Similar class/interface names
- Common method signatures
- Repeated import patterns
- Similar file structures

[ ] Use codebase_search for:

- Similar functionality descriptions
- Related component purposes
- Matching business logic

[ ] Cross-reference with:

- Package dependencies
- Import statements
- Usage patterns

### 4. Documentation Analysis

[ ] Review architecture docs for:

- Multiple implementations of same feature
- Overlapping system descriptions
- Redundant integration points

[ ] Check integration docs for:

- Duplicate service registrations
- Multiple handlers for same events
- Repeated initialization patterns

### 5. Test Coverage Analysis

[ ] Analyze test files for:

- Multiple test suites for same functionality
- Duplicate test utilities
- Redundant mock implementations

### Implementation Steps

1. Run automated searches:

   ```bash
   - Search for common prefi es/suffi es
   - Identify similar file names
   - Find matching interfaces/classes
   ```

2. Group results by category:

   ```
   - Services/Managers
   - Components/UI
   - Utils/Helpers
   - Tests/Mocks
   ```

3. Cross-reference findings:

   ```
   - Check import statements
   - Verify usage patterns
   - Review documentation
   ```

4. Document in Duplicate_Scratchpad.md:

   ```
   - Confirmed duplicates
   - Potential duplicates
   - Required investigation
   ```

5. Prioritize consolidation:
   ```
   - High impact (core services)
   - Medium impact (components)
   - Low impact (utilities)
   ```
