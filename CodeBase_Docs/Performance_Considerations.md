## Resource Flow Optimization

The resource flow optimization process, implemented in the `optimizeFlows` method of `ResourceFlowManager`, is one of the most computationally intensive operations in the game. It handles the calculation and distribution of resources across the entire network of producers, consumers, storage nodes, and converters.

### Critical Path: ResourceFlowManager.optimizeFlows

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the optimization process depends on several factors:

- **N**: Number of nodes in the network
- **C**: Number of connections between nodes
- **R**: Number of different resource types
- **P**: Number of priority levels

In the worst case, the time complexity approaches:

- O(N + C × log(P) + R × C)

Where:

- Node processing is linear (O(N))
- Connection priority sorting is O(C × log(P))
- Resource distribution calculation is O(R × C)

For large networks with many connections, this operation can become a performance bottleneck.

#### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Throttled Execution**

   ```typescript
   // Skip optimization if not enough time has passed
   if (startTime - this.lastOptimization < this.optimizationInterval) {
     return {
       transfers: [],
       updatedConnections: [],
       bottlenecks: [],
       underutilized: [],
       performanceMetrics: {
         executionTimeMs: 0,
         nodesProcessed: 0,
         connectionsProcessed: 0,
         transfersGenerated: 0,
       },
     };
   }
   ```

   - The optimization only runs after a configurable interval has passed
   - Prevents excessive CPU usage from frequent optimization calls
   - Default interval: 5000ms (configurable in constructor)

2. **Batch Processing**

   ```typescript
   // Process converters in batches if there are many
   const batchCount = Math.ceil(converters.length / this.batchSize);

   for (let i = 0; i < batchCount; i++) {
     const batchStart = i * this.batchSize;
     const batchEnd = Math.min((i + 1) * this.batchSize, converters.length);
     const converterBatch = converters.slice(batchStart, batchEnd);
     // Process batch
   }
   ```

   - Large networks are processed in configurable batch sizes
   - Prevents blocking the main thread for too long
   - Applies to converter processing, resource balance calculation, and flow rate optimization
   - Default batch size: 100 nodes/connections (configurable in constructor)

3. **Active Node Filtering**

   ```typescript
   // Get active nodes and connections
   const activeNodes = Array.from(this.network.nodes.values()).filter(node => node.active);
   const activeConnections = Array.from(this.network.connections.values()).filter(
     conn => conn.active
   );
   ```

   - Only active nodes and connections are processed
   - Inactive nodes are skipped entirely, reducing computation time
   - Allows for dynamic network optimization by activating/deactivating parts of the network

4. **Resource State Caching**

   ```typescript
   public getResourceState(type: ResourceType): ResourceState | undefined {
     const now = Date.now();

     // Check cache first
     const cacheEntry = this.resourceCache.get(type);
     if (cacheEntry && now < cacheEntry.expiresAt) {
       return cacheEntry.state;
     }

     // Cache miss or expired, get from network
     const state = this.network.resourceStates.get(type);

     // Update cache if state exists
     if (state) {
       this.resourceCache.set(type, {
         state,
         lastUpdated: now,
         expiresAt: now + this.cacheTTL,
       });
     }

     return state;
   }
   ```

   - Resource states are cached with a configurable TTL
   - Reduces repeated calculations for frequent state queries
   - Cache is invalidated when states are updated
   - Default cache TTL: 2000ms (configurable in constructor)

5. **Priority-Based Processing**

   ```typescript
   // Sort connections by priority
   const sortedConnections = connections.sort((a, b) => {
     const priorityA = a.priority.priority || 0;
     const priorityB = b.priority.priority || 0;
     return priorityB - priorityA; // Higher priority first
   });
   ```

   - Connections are processed in priority order
   - Ensures critical resources are handled first
   - Enables graceful degradation when resources are limited

6. **Incremental Updates**

   ```typescript
   return {
     transfers,
     updatedConnections, // Only connections that changed
     bottlenecks,
     underutilized,
     performanceMetrics: {
       executionTimeMs,
       nodesProcessed,
       connectionsProcessed,
       transfersGenerated,
     },
   };
   ```

   - Only returns connections that actually changed
   - Reduces the work needed for consumers to update their state
   - Includes performance metrics for monitoring

7. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   ```typescript
   const startTime = Date.now();
   // ... perform optimization ...
   const endTime = Date.now();
   const executionTimeMs = endTime - startTime;
   ```
   - All operations are timed
   - Node and connection processing counts are tracked
   - Metrics are included in the result for monitoring and debugging

### Optimization Recommendations

1. **Web Worker Offloading**

   - For extremely large networks (>1000 nodes), consider offloading optimization to a Web Worker
   - This prevents blocking the main thread during complex calculations
   - Implementation would require serialization of network state

2. **Spatial Partitioning**

   - For geographically distributed networks, implement spatial partitioning
   - Only optimize connections within relevant partitions
   - Reduces the effective network size for each optimization pass

3. **Asynchronous Processing**

   - Convert the optimization process to use async/await
   - Break up long-running operations with await setTimeout(0)
   - Allows the main thread to handle other tasks between batches

4. **Predictive Optimization**
   - Implement resource flow prediction based on current trends
   - Only perform full optimization when predictions significantly diverge from actual values
   - Can reduce optimization frequency for stable networks

## Event Processing

The event system is another critical path, especially when many events are emitted in a short period.

### Critical Path: ModuleEventBus.emit

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for event emission depends on:

- **L**: Number of listeners for a specific event type
- **H**: Size of the event history

For each event emission, the complexity is O(L + min(1, H/maxHistorySize)), where:

- Notifying listeners is O(L)
- History management (add + potential removal) is O(min(1, H/maxHistorySize))

#### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Selective Event Delivery**

   - Events are only delivered to subscribed listeners
   - Listeners are stored in type-specific Sets for O(1) lookup

2. **History Size Limiting**

   - Event history is capped at a configurable maximum size
   - Oldest events are removed when the limit is reached
   - Prevents unbounded memory growth

3. **Error Isolation**

   - Errors in one listener don't prevent other listeners from receiving events
   - Each listener is called within a try/catch block

4. **Event Filtering**
   - The API supports retrieving filtered event history
   - Filters are applied after retrieval to leverage V8 optimizations

### Optimization Recommendations

1. **Event Batching**

   - For high-frequency events, implement event batching
   - Collect events for a short period (e.g., 16ms) before processing
   - Reduces listener invocation overhead

2. **Listener Throttling**

   - Add support for throttled listeners that only receive events at a maximum frequency
   - Useful for UI updates that don't need to reflect every event

3. **History Indexing**
   - Implement indexing for common query patterns (moduleId, type)
   - Speeds up filtered history retrieval for large history sizes

## React Component Rendering

React component rendering, particularly for complex UI elements that display resource networks, can become a bottleneck.

### Critical Path: ResourceVisualization Component

#### Complexity Analysis

The rendering complexity depends on:

- **N**: Number of resource nodes displayed
- **C**: Number of connections between nodes
- **E**: Number of effects/animations active

The render complexity approaches O(N + C + E) in the worst case.

#### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Memoization**

   ```typescript
   const MemoizedResourceNode = React.memo(ResourceNode);
   ```

   - Components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Only re-renders when props actually change

2. **Virtual Rendering**

   - Only visible nodes and connections are fully rendered
   - Off-screen elements are simplified or not rendered

3. **Throttled Updates**
   - UI updates from high-frequency events are throttled
   - Prevents excessive re-rendering during rapid state changes

### Optimization Recommendations

1. **Canvas Rendering**

   - For very large networks (>100 visible nodes), consider switching to Canvas rendering
   - Reduces DOM node count and improves rendering performance

2. **Visibility-Based Optimization**

   - Implement progressive detail levels based on zoom level
   - Show less detail for distant or numerous nodes

3. **Worker-Based Layout Calculation**
   - Offload complex layout calculations to a Web Worker
   - Only update the DOM with the final positions

## Performance Monitoring

Effective performance monitoring is essential for identifying bottlenecks and validating optimizations.

### Implemented Monitoring

1. **Execution Time Tracking**

   - Critical operations track and report execution time
   - Included in operation results for logging and analysis

2. **Operation Metrics**

   - Node and connection processing counts are tracked
   - Transfer generation and other key metrics are recorded

3. **Benchmark Suite**
   - Dedicated benchmarks for critical systems
   - Tests different network sizes and configurations

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Real-Time Performance Dashboard**

   - Implement a developer-focused performance dashboard
   - Show real-time metrics for critical paths
   - Support filtering and historical comparison

2. **Automated Performance Regression Testing**

   - Add performance tests to the CI pipeline
   - Alert on significant performance regressions

3. **User-Focused Performance Metrics**
   - Collect performance metrics from real users
   - Identify common bottlenecks in production environments
   - Prioritize optimizations based on actual impact
