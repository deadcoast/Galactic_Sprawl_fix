# CURSOR SYSTEM INTEGRATION FILE

## PROPERLY UTILIZING THE ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

This file documents the current state of the system architecture. It serves as a comprehensive reference for all system components, their relationships, and implementation status. When analyzing the codebase, refer to this document to understand the intended architecture, identify gaps between the current implementation and the architectural vision, and determine what connections need to be established or fixed. This document represents the `source of truth` for system architecture decisions and should inform all implementation work.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

When working with this architectural documentation:

1. Reference specific components using their unique identifiers to ensure precise communication about system elements
2. Parse all JSON objects and TypeScript interfaces as structured specifications that define the intended implementation
3. When implementing a component, first analyze the relevant codebase files to understand current implementation status
4. Fill in any placeholder values in the interfaces with concrete code implementations that align with architectural standards
5. Present implementation suggestions with specific code examples that follow the architectural patterns
6. Generate actionable code that fulfills the requirements specified in each component section

The document serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the system architecture, with each section containing machine-readable specifications that guide implementation decisions. I will maintain consistency with these specifications when suggesting code changes or additions.

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

When suggesting implementations based on this document, I will:

1. First identify the component and its connections in the architecture specification
2. Reference the implementation status to understand what needs to be built or modified
3. Follow the specified connection patterns when implementing component relationships
4. Ensure new code aligns with the architectural patterns defined in the document
5. Address any identified issues or missing connections with solutions that conform to the architecture

This approach ensures that all implementation work contributes to a cohesive system that matches the intended architecture while addressing the current state of the codebase.

   - The ModuleUpgradeVisualization component shows upgrade progress

2. **Event-Based Communication**:

   - Module components subscribe to module events using the standardized useEventSubscription hook
   - Components automatically update when module state changes
   - Event subscriptions are cleaned up on component unmount

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Comprehensive tests verify the integration between UI components and the ModuleManager
   - Tests check the end-to-end flow from module selection to upgrading
   - Performance monitoring is included to detect rendering issues

```

### Integration Points

The Component Registration System establishes the following key integration points:

1. **UI Components to Events System**:

   - Components register their interest in specific events
   - Event propagation is optimized to only notify relevant components
   - Automatic cleanup on component unmount prevents memory leaks

2. **Performance Monitoring**:

   - Tracks component render counts and render times
   - Identifies components exceeding performance thresholds
   - Provides aggregated performance reports

3. **Centralized Component Management**:
   - Maintains registry of all active UI components
   - Tracks component types and counts
   - Enables component lookup by various criteria

### Implementation Details

```typescript
interface ComponentMetadata {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for the component
  type: string; // Component type (e.g., 'ResourceDisplay')
  eventSubscriptions: string[]; // Events this component is interested in
  updatePriority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // Priority for updates

  // Performance metrics
  renderCount?: number;
  averageRenderTime?: number;
  totalRenderTime?: number;
  lastUpdated?: number;
}

// Registry methods
interface ComponentRegistry {
  registerComponent(metadata: ComponentMetadata): () => void;
  getComponentsByEvent(eventType: string): ComponentMetadata[];
  updateComponentMetrics(id: string, renderTime: number): void;
  getAllComponents(): ComponentMetadata[];
  getComponentById(id: string): ComponentMetadata | undefined;
  getComponentsByType(type: string): ComponentMetadata[];
  getPerformanceReport(): PerformanceReport;
  notifyComponentsOfEvent(eventType: string, eventData: unknown): void;
}

// Hook implementations
function useComponentRegistration(options: ComponentRegistrationOptions): string;
function useComponentLifecycle(options: ComponentLifecycleOptions): void;
```

### Usage Pattern

```tsx
// Example component implementation using the registration system
const ExampleComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // Register with the component registry
  const componentId = useComponentRegistration({
    type: 'ExampleComponent',
    eventSubscriptions: ['EXAMPLE_EVENT_TYPE', 'ANOTHER_EVENT_TYPE'],
    updatePriority: 'medium',
  });

  // Set up lifecycle and event handlers
  useComponentLifecycle({
    onMount: () => console.log('Component mounted'),
    onUnmount: () => console.log('Component unmounted'),
    eventSubscriptions: [
      {
        eventType: 'EXAMPLE_EVENT_TYPE',
        handler: event => handleExampleEvent(event),
      },
    ],
  });

  // Component implementation
  return <div>Example Component</div>;
};
```

### Next Implementation Steps

   - GameHUD

2. Enhance the system with:

   - Automated performance monitoring and reporting

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**

 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**

 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,

      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);

5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**

 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,

      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {

      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);

5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry

export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {

    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods

    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

# CURSOR SYSTEM INTEGRATION FILE

## PROPERLY UTILIZING THE ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

This file documents the current state of the system architecture. It serves as a comprehensive reference for all system components, their relationships, and implementation status. When analyzing the codebase, refer to this document to understand the intended architecture, identify gaps between the current implementation and the architectural vision, and determine what connections need to be established or fixed. This document represents the `source of truth` for system architecture decisions and should inform all implementation work.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

When working with this architectural documentation:

1. Reference specific components using their unique identifiers to ensure precise communication about system elements
2. Parse all JSON objects and TypeScript interfaces as structured specifications that define the intended implementation
3. When implementing a component, first analyze the relevant codebase files to understand current implementation status
4. Fill in any placeholder values in the interfaces with concrete code implementations that align with architectural standards
5. Present implementation suggestions with specific code examples that follow the architectural patterns
6. Generate actionable code that fulfills the requirements specified in each component section

The document serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the system architecture, with each section containing machine-readable specifications that guide implementation decisions. I will maintain consistency with these specifications when suggesting code changes or additions.

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

When suggesting implementations based on this document, I will:

1. First identify the component and its connections in the architecture specification
2. Reference the implementation status to understand what needs to be built or modified
3. Follow the specified connection patterns when implementing component relationships
4. Ensure new code aligns with the architectural patterns defined in the document
5. Address any identified issues or missing connections with solutions that conform to the architecture

This approach ensures that all implementation work contributes to a cohesive system that matches the intended architecture while addressing the current state of the codebase.

   - The ModuleCard component displays module information and provides controls
   - The ModuleGrid component allows filtering and sorting of modules
   - The ModuleUpgradeVisualization component shows upgrade progress

2. **Event-Based Communication**:

   - Module components subscribe to module events using the standardized useEventSubscription hook
   - Components automatically update when module state changes
   - Event subscriptions are cleaned up on component unmount

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Comprehensive tests verify the integration between UI components and the ModuleManager
   - Tests check the end-to-end flow from module selection to upgrading
   - Performance monitoring is included to detect rendering issues

## Component Registration System

**Implementation ID**: `phase2.ui.componentRegistry`

### Current Implementation Status

- Fully implemented with core services and hooks in place
- ComponentRegistryService in `src/services/ComponentRegistryService.ts` - implements centralized component tracking system
- useComponentRegistration hook in `src/hooks/ui/useComponentRegistration.ts` - provides React integration for components
- useComponentLifecycle hook in `src/hooks/ui/useComponentLifecycle.ts` - manages component lifecycle and event subscriptions
- ResourceDisplay component in `src/components/ui/resource/ResourceDisplay.tsx` - example implementation
- ResourceRegistrationDemo in `src/components/ui/resource/ResourceRegistrationDemo.tsx` - demonstration component
- ResourceVisualizationEnhanced in `src/components/ui/resource/ResourceVisualizationEnhanced.tsx` - enhanced resource visualization using the component registration system

### Architecture

```typescript
interface ComponentRegistrationSystem {
  services: {
    ComponentRegistryService: {
      purpose: 'Centralized tracking of all UI components';
      capabilities: [
        'Component registration and unregistration',
        'Event subscription management',
        'Performance metrics tracking',
        'Component lookup by ID, type, and event subscription',
      ];
      connections: [
        { to: 'EventPropagationService'; connection_type: 'event_distribution' },
        { to: 'React UI Components'; connection_type: 'registration_hooks' },
      ];
    };
  };

  hooks: {
    useComponentRegistration: {
      purpose: 'Register React components with the registry';
      parameters: {
        type: 'Component type identifier';
        eventSubscriptions: 'Array of event types the component listens to';
        updatePriority: 'Priority level for updates (high, medium, low)';
      };
      return: 'Component ID for tracking';
    };

    useComponentLifecycle: {
      purpose: 'Manage component lifecycle and event subscriptions';
      capabilities: [
        'Mount/unmount event handling',
        'Automatic event subscription setup and cleanup',
        'Performance tracking integration',
      ];
    };
  };

  demo_components: {
    ResourceDisplay: 'Example implementation of registration pattern';
    ResourceRegistrationDemo: 'Demo UI for showcasing registry capabilities';
  };
}
```

### Integration Points

The Component Registration System establishes the following key integration points:

1. **UI Components to Events System**:

   - Components register their interest in specific events
   - Event propagation is optimized to only notify relevant components
   - Automatic cleanup on component unmount prevents memory leaks

2. **Performance Monitoring**:

   - Tracks component render counts and render times
   - Identifies components exceeding performance thresholds
   - Provides aggregated performance reports

3. **Centralized Component Management**:
   - Maintains registry of all active UI components
   - Tracks component types and counts
   - Enables component lookup by various criteria

### Implementation Details

```typescript
interface ComponentMetadata {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for the component
  type: string; // Component type (e.g., 'ResourceDisplay')
  eventSubscriptions: string[]; // Events this component is interested in
  updatePriority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // Priority for updates

  // Performance metrics
  renderCount?: number;
  averageRenderTime?: number;
  totalRenderTime?: number;
  lastUpdated?: number;
}

// Registry methods
interface ComponentRegistry {
  registerComponent(metadata: ComponentMetadata): () => void;
  getComponentsByEvent(eventType: string): ComponentMetadata[];
  updateComponentMetrics(id: string, renderTime: number): void;
  getAllComponents(): ComponentMetadata[];
  getComponentById(id: string): ComponentMetadata | undefined;
  getComponentsByType(type: string): ComponentMetadata[];
  getPerformanceReport(): PerformanceReport;
  notifyComponentsOfEvent(eventType: string, eventData: unknown): void;
}

// Hook implementations
function useComponentRegistration(options: ComponentRegistrationOptions): string;
function useComponentLifecycle(options: ComponentLifecycleOptions): void;
```

### Usage Pattern

```tsx
// Example component implementation using the registration system
const ExampleComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // Register with the component registry
  const componentId = useComponentRegistration({
    type: 'ExampleComponent',
    eventSubscriptions: ['EXAMPLE_EVENT_TYPE', 'ANOTHER_EVENT_TYPE'],
    updatePriority: 'medium',
  });

  // Set up lifecycle and event handlers
  useComponentLifecycle({
    onMount: () => console.log('Component mounted'),
    onUnmount: () => console.log('Component unmounted'),
    eventSubscriptions: [
      {
        eventType: 'EXAMPLE_EVENT_TYPE',
        handler: event => handleExampleEvent(event),
      },
    ],
  });

  // Component implementation
  return <div>Example Component</div>;
};
```

### Next Implementation Steps

1. Apply the component registration pattern to core UI components:

   - ResourceVisualization âœ… (Implemented in ResourceVisualizationEnhanced)
   - ModuleStatusDisplay
   - GameHUD

2. Enhance the system with:

   - Automated performance monitoring and reporting
   - Event subscription optimization
   - Component rendering optimization based on metrics

3. Create comprehensive documentation and developer guides for adopting the pattern

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**

 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval

5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**

 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,

      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {

      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);

5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

### Exploration System Integration Details

The Exploration System has been integrated with the core architecture following standardized patterns:

#### Manager Implementation

The ExplorationManager implements the BaseManager interface to provide consistent behavior with other system managers:

1. **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `initialize()`, `update()`, and `dispose()` methods for standard lifecycle
2. **Event Communication**: Uses the EventBus for publishing standardized events
3. **Dependency Management**: Receives dependencies through the ServiceRegistry
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Exposes statistics through the getMetadata() interface

```typescript
/**
 * ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager to integrate with the core systems
 * - Implements standardized lifecycle methods
 * - Uses EventBus for event-based communication
 * - Provides performance metrics
 */
export class ExplorationManager extends AbstractBaseManager<BaseEvent> {
  constructor(eventBus: EventBus<BaseEvent>, shipManager: ReconShipManagerImpl) {
    super('ExplorationManager', eventBus);
    this.shipManager = shipManager;
  }

  // Lifecycle methods
  protected async onInitialize(dependencies?: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<void> {
    // Initialization logic with dependency injection
    this.subscribeToEvent(EventType.STATUS_CHANGED, this.handleShipStatusChange);
  }

  protected onUpdate(deltaTime: number): void {
    // Update logic for active scan operations
    this.updateScanOperations(deltaTime);
  }

  // Event publishing
  private completeScanOperation(operationId: string): void {
    // Operation completion logic
    this.publishEvent(
      this.createEvent(ExplorationEvents.SCAN_COMPLETED, {
        sector,
        operation,
      })
    );
  }
}
```

#### Context Provider Integration

The DataAnalysisContext connects with the ExplorationManager through event subscriptions:

1. **Automated Dataset Creation**: Automatically creates datasets from exploration events
2. **Data Transformation**: Converts exploration entities to standardized DataPoints
3. **Type Safety**: Uses strongly-typed interfaces for all data transformations
4. **Resource Optimization**: Implements efficient data storage and retrieval

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisContext integrates with ExplorationManager through event subscriptions
 * - Creates datasets automatically from exploration events
 * - Provides custom hooks for UI components
 */
export const DataAnalysisProvider: React.FC<DataAnalysisProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  initialDatasets = [],
  initialAnalysisConfigs = [],
  initialAnalysisResults = [],
}) => {
  // Event subscriptions
  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to exploration events
    const unsubscribeSector = explorationManager.subscribeToEvent(
      asEventType(ExplorationEvents.SECTOR_DISCOVERED),
      handleSectorDiscovered
    );

    // More subscriptions...

    // Cleanup
    return () => {
      unsubscribeSector();
      // More unsubscriptions...
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Context value
  const contextValue: DataAnalysisContextType = {
    // Context data and methods...
  };

  return <DataAnalysisContext.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</DataAnalysisContext.Provider>;
};
```

#### UI Component Integration

The DataAnalysisSystem UI component integrates with the ExplorationManager through the DataAnalysisContext:

1. **Real-time Data Display**: Shows live exploration statistics
2. **Automatic Updates**: Periodically refreshes data from ExplorationManager
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Displays datasets generated from exploration events
4. **Interaction Patterns**: Follows standardized UI patterns for consistency

```typescript
/**
 * DataAnalysisSystem integrates with exploration data through:
 * - DataAnalysisContext for datasets and analysis results
 * - ExplorationManager.getMetadata() for statistics
 */
export function DataAnalysisSystem({ className = '' }: DataAnalysisSystemProps) {
  // Context usage
  const {
    datasets,
    analysisConfigs,
    analysisResults,
    // More context values...
  } = useDataAnalysis();

  // Get exploration-specific datasets
  const explorationDatasets = React.useMemo(() => {
    return datasets.filter(dataset =>
      ['sectors', 'anomalies', 'resources'].includes(dataset.source)
    );
  }, [datasets]);

  // Statistics update
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const updateStats = () => {
      const stats = explorationManager.getMetadata().stats || {};
      setExplorationStats({
        // Mapping stats...
      });
    };

    // Update interval
    const interval = setInterval(updateStats, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Render UI with exploration data
  return (
    // Component JSX...
  );
}
```

### Planned Integration Enhancements

Future integration work for the Exploration System includes:

1. **Resource System Integration**: Connect discovered resources to the resource extraction system
2. **Technology System Integration**: Link anomalies to the research and technology tree
3. **Mission System Integration**: Generate exploration missions based on discovered sectors
4. **Ship Management Integration**: Enhance ship assignment and management capabilities
5. **Classification Algorithm Integration**: Implement AI-based classification of discoveries

## Context Implementation

### Current Implementation

We have moved away from using the `createStandardContext` utility to a direct React context implementation using hooks. This approach:

1. Eliminates circular dependencies that were causing issues in tests
2. Provides more control over context creation and subscription management
3. Improves type safety and reduces reliance on utility functions

The contexts that have been refactored to use this new pattern are:

- ResourceRatesContext
- GameContext

### Benefits of the New Pattern

- No circular dependencies between contexts and their consumers
- Better test compatibility with mocking frameworks
- Improved type safety with explicit state and action types
- More explicit control over subscriptions and event handling
- Easier to understand and maintain

### Integration with Managers

The new context pattern maintains the same integration with managers as before:

- Managers are passed to the context provider as props
- The context subscribes to manager events and updates state accordingly
- Actions in the context can trigger manager methods
- The manager is included in the context value for direct access when needed

### Event Handling

Event handling has been improved with:

- Better type safety for event subscriptions
- Safer cleanup of event subscriptions
- More explicit error handling for subscription failures

### Future Improvements

- Fix type compatibility issues between different event type systems
- Standardize this pattern across all contexts
- Create better documentation for how to properly test these contexts
- Improve error handling and logging for context operations
