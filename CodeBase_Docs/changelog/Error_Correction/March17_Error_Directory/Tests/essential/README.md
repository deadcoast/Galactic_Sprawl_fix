# Error Correction Workflow - Simplified Tests

This directory contains a simplified, consolidated setup for testing the error correction workflow.

## Files

- test_master.sh - A single test script for both ResourceType and unused variable fixes
- test_resource_types.ts - Test file for ResourceType fixes
- test_unused_vars.ts - Test file for unused variable fixes

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
chmod +x test_master.sh
./test_master.sh
```

## Why Simplified?

The original testing setup included many redundant files.
This consolidated setup provides the same test coverage with a cleaner structure.
