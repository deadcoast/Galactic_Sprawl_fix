# Test Results for Type Safety and Null Safety Fixes

## Type Safety Fixes

The Type Safety fix script (`fix_type_safety.sh`) includes the following features:

- Converting `any` types to specific types where possible
- Fixing array type issues (`[]` → `Type[]`)
- Adding proper type assertions
- Adding function return types

Tests were created to verify these features using sample TypeScript code with intentional type issues.

**Test Status**: ✅ Verified manually with simplified test cases

## Null Safety Fixes

The Null Safety fix script (`fix_null_safety.sh`) includes the following features:

- Adding optional chaining (`?.`) for potentially null objects
- Adding nullish coalescing (`??`) for default values
- Adding null checks before property access
- Adding non-null assertions where appropriate

Tests were created to verify these features using sample TypeScript code with null safety issues.

**Test Status**: ✅ Verified manually with simplified test cases

## Manual Testing Steps

Both scripts were tested by:

1. Creating TypeScript files with known type and null safety issues
2. Running the respective fix scripts on these files
3. Verifying that the fixes were applied correctly
4. Checking that the fixed code follows TypeScript best practices

## Integration Testing

The unified script runner (`run_targeted_fixes.sh`) can be used to apply both types of fixes:

```bash
./run_targeted_fixes.sh --target=path/to/code --fix=resource,type,null --progressive --analyze-first --verification
```

This ensures that Type Safety and Null Safety fixes can be applied together as part of an integrated workflow.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining the fix scripts to handle more edge cases
- Add full integration tests with real-world code examples
- Implement performance benchmarks for large codebases
