# Error Analysis and Correction Workflow

This directory contains a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors in the Galactic Sprawl codebase. The workflow is designed to be systematic, repeatable, and efficient.

## Directory Structure

- **Analysis/**: Contains raw error data and analysis results

  - **TypeScript/**: TypeScript error logs categorized by type
  - **ESLint/**: ESLint error logs categorized by rule
  - **Dependencies/**: Dependency and package issues

- **Categories/**: Categorized error documentation

  - **ResourceTypes/**: Resource type related errors
  - **EventSystem/**: Event system related errors
  - **TypeSafety/**: General type safety issues
  - **Components/**: React component errors
  - **Managers/**: Manager implementation errors

- **Scripts/**: Automation scripts for error analysis and fixes

  - All scripts include detailed documentation and usage examples

- **Reports/**: Generated reports from the analysis

  - Daily progress reports
  - Error trend analysis
  - Priority recommendations

- **Fixes/**: Templates and examples for common fixes
  - Code snippets for common error patterns
  - Automated fix scripts for batch corrections

## Workflow Overview

1. **Analyze**: Run the error analysis scripts to gather and categorize errors
2. **Prioritize**: Review the reports to identify high-impact areas
3. **Fix**: Apply fixes using the templates and scripts
4. **Verify**: Re-run analysis to confirm fixes and identify new issues
5. **Report**: Generate progress reports to track improvements

## Getting Started

1. Run the full system analysis:

```bash
cd CodeBase_Docs/changelog/Error_Correction/March17_Error_Directory
./Scripts/analyze_all.sh
```

2. Review the generated reports in the `Reports` directory

3. Address the highest priority errors first, following the recommended order in the reports

## Scripts

See the [Scripts README](./Scripts/README.md) for detailed information on all available scripts.

## Reports

Reports are automatically generated during analysis and are stored in the `Reports` directory. The main reports include:

- `error_summary.md`: Overview of all errors by category
- `priority_report.md`: Recommended order for fixing errors
- `daily_progress.md`: Day-to-day progress tracking

## Common Error Categories

1. **Resource Type Errors**: Issues related to the use of string literals instead of ResourceType enum
2. **Event System Errors**: Problems with event handling, subscriptions, and type safety
3. **Component Props**: Incorrect prop types or missing required props
4. **Manager Implementation**: Issues in manager classes, including singleton patterns and method implementations
5. **Type Safety**: General type safety issues, including `any` types and type assertions

## Contributing

When fixing errors:

1. Document the fix in the appropriate category directory
2. Update the error tracking information
3. Run verification tests after applying fixes
4. Update the daily progress report
