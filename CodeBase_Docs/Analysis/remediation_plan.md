# Remediation Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ Created a comprehensive fix script (`fix_resources.sh`) that combines all resource type fixes
- ✅ Fixed ResourceTypeMigration.ts imports to include ResourceTypeString
- ✅ Fixed duplicate imports in ResourceDiscoverySystem.tsx
- ✅ Updated component props to use ResourceType enum instead of string
- ✅ Fixed string literals to use ResourceType enum values
- ✅ Fixed object literals with string resourceType
- ✅ Fixed specific files with remaining issues
- ✅ Fixed files that use ResourceTypeMigration
- ✅ Fixed duplicate React imports
- ✅ Fixed ESLint custom rule file and configuration
- ✅ Fixed ResourceTypes.js and DataAnalysisTypes.js by removing redundant JS files
- ✅ Fixed resourceValidation.ts with proper type imports and implementations
- ✅ Fixed ResourceTypeMigration.ts type issues and improved type safety
- ✅ Created standardized event interfaces and base implementations
- ✅ Implemented proper event history tracking in useModuleEvents.ts
- ⏳ Remaining TypeScript errors: 1331 (down from 1785)

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Event System Implementation (Current Focus)

#### Completed Steps

- ✅ Created standardized event interfaces (`IEventEmitter`, `ITypedEventEmitter`)
- ✅ Created base event emitter implementations (`BaseEventEmitter`, `BaseTypedEventEmitter`)
- ✅ Created ship, module, faction, and combat event definitions
- ✅ Updated `ShipHangarManager` and `StandardShipHangarManager`
- ✅ Updated `BaseModuleManager` to use the new event system
- ✅ Updated `useFactionBehavior` and `useCombatAI` hooks
- ✅ Created `CombatManager` class extending `BaseTypedEventEmitter`
- ✅ Implemented proper event history tracking in useModuleEvents.ts
- ✅ Updated `ResourceManager` to use the new event system
- ✅ Updated `ExplorationManager` to use standardized event types
- ✅ Added type guards for resource and exploration events
- ✅ Updated `ColonyManager` to use the new event system
- ✅ Added type guards for colony events

#### Next Steps

1. Fix component event subscriptions:

   - [ ] Update resource-related components to use new event system
   - [ ] Update exploration components to use standardized events
   - [ ] Update colony management components
   - [ ] Ensure proper event unsubscription in all components

2. Standardize event handling:
   - [ ] Review and standardize event payload interfaces
   - [ ] Add runtime validation for event payloads
   - [ ] Create event utility functions for common operations
   - [ ] Document event flow and best practices

### 2. Type Safety Improvements

#### Next Steps

1. Replace 'any' types with proper interfaces:

   - [ ] Create specific interfaces for complex data structures
   - [ ] Use unknown type with type guards where appropriate
   - [ ] Implement generics for reusable components

2. Fix visualization component types:

   - [ ] Replace 'any' types in chart renderers
   - [ ] Create proper interfaces for visualization data
   - [ ] Implement type-safe D3 wrappers

3. Add type guards for runtime type checking:
   - ✅ Implement isResourceType and other type guards
   - [ ] Add runtime validation for external data
   - [ ] Use type predicates for narrowing types

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

#### Next Steps

1. Fix unused variables and imports:

   - [ ] Remove or prefix unused variables
   - [ ] Clean up unnecessary imports
   - [ ] Update import statements to be more specific

2. Improve code organization:

   - [ ] Standardize file and folder structure
   - [ ] Group related functionality
   - [ ] Create index files for better module organization

3. Add comprehensive documentation:
   - [ ] Document all event types and payloads
   - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to public methods
   - [ ] Create usage examples for common patterns

## Progress Tracking

Current metrics (as of latest report):

- TypeScript Errors: 1331 (decreased from 1785, 25% improvement)
- ESLint Errors: 606 (increased from 551)
- ESLint Warnings: 503 (decreased from 725, 30% improvement)

### Error Type Progress

- Type Mismatches: 35% improvement
- Missing Properties: -18% (regression)
- Any Type Usage: -18% (regression)
- Unused Variables: -13% (regression)

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Component Event System Updates**

   - Update resource-related components
   - Update exploration components
   - Update colony management components
   - Ensure proper event cleanup

2. **Type Safety Improvements**

   - Focus on visualization components
   - Add missing type guards
   - Fix remaining any types

3. **Code Quality**
   - Address unused variables
   - Improve code organization
   - Add comprehensive documentation

## Success Metrics

We'll continue tracking:

1. TypeScript error count (target: <500)
2. ESLint error count (target: <200)
3. ESLint warning count (target: <300)
4. Test coverage (target: >80%)
5. Build success rate (target: >95%)
