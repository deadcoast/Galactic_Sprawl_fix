# System Integration

## Code Duplication Impact on System Integration

The identified code duplication patterns have significant implications for system integration. This section outlines how the consolidation efforts will affect integration points and provides guidance for maintaining system stability during the refactoring process.

### Current Integration Challenges

1. **Inconsistent Service Access Patterns**

   - Multiple service registry implementations create confusion about how to access services
   - Different singleton patterns lead to inconsistent service initialization
   - Integration points often duplicate service access logic

2. **Event System Fragmentation**

   - Components using different event systems cannot easily communicate
   - Cross-cutting concerns like logging and error handling are implemented inconsistently
   - Event subscription management varies across the codebase

3. **Resource Management Inconsistencies**

   - Different resource management implementations use incompatible interfaces
   - Resource flow, storage, and transfer logic is fragmented
   - Integration points often need to adapt between different resource representations

4. **Visualization Integration Complexity**
   - Multiple chart implementations with different APIs increase integration complexity
   - Memory optimization strategies vary across visualization components
   - Error handling is inconsistent across visualization boundaries

### Integration Strategy During Consolidation

To maintain system stability during the consolidation process, follow these integration guidelines:

1. **Facade Pattern for Legacy Code**

   - Create facade interfaces over existing implementations before refactoring
   - Gradually migrate consumers to use the facade interfaces
   - Replace implementations behind the facades without changing consumer code

2. **Adapter Pattern for System Boundaries**

   - Use adapters to connect systems using different patterns
   - Standardize data transfer objects (DTOs) at system boundaries
   - Document integration points clearly

3. **Feature Flags for Gradual Migration**

   - Use feature flags to enable new implementations selectively
   - Test new implementations in isolation before enabling globally
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition periods

4. **Integration Testing Focus**
   - Prioritize integration tests for systems affected by consolidation
   - Verify behavior consistency across system boundaries
   - Test both old and new implementations during transition

### Key Integration Points to Monitor

During the consolidation process, pay special attention to these critical integration points:

1. **Service Initialization Sequence**

   - Monitor dependencies between services during initialization
   - Ensure consistent error handling during service startup
   - Maintain backward compatibility for service consumers

2. **Event Communication Channels**

   - Document event types and payloads at system boundaries
   - Ensure events are properly propagated across system boundaries
   - Verify event subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks

3. **Resource Flow Boundaries**

   - Monitor resource transfer between different management systems
   - Ensure consistent resource type validation at boundaries
   - Verify resource accounting accuracy across systems

4. **UI Component Composition**

   - Test component composition across different UI frameworks
   - Verify prop passing and event bubbling behavior
   - Ensure consistent error boundary behavior

5. **Worker Communication**
   - Monitor message passing between main thread and workers
   - Ensure consistent serialization/deserialization of messages
   - Verify error handling across thread boundaries

### Integration Documentation Requirements

For each consolidated system, document the following integration aspects:

1. **Public API**

   - Document stable public interfaces for consumers
   - Clearly mark deprecated APIs and migration paths
   - Provide usage examples for common integration scenarios

2. **Event Contract**

   - Document event types, payloads, and validation requirements
   - Specify event ordering guarantees and delivery semantics
   - Provide subscription management best practices

3. **Resource Flow**

   - Document resource type specifications and validation rules
   - Specify resource transfer protocols between systems
   - Document resource accounting and reconciliation processes

4. **Error Handling**

   - Specify error propagation across system boundaries
   - Document recovery procedures for common failure scenarios
   - Provide guidelines for graceful degradation

5. **Performance Characteristics**
   - Document expected performance characteristics
   - Specify resource usage limits and scaling behavior
   - Provide monitoring and profiling guidelines
