# GALACTIC SPRAWL SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive system integration documentation for the Galactic Sprawl project. Each module is documented in its own file for easier maintenance and navigation.

## Directory Structure

### Core Documentation

- `01_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Core architecture principles and usage instructions
- `02_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level system overview and implementation timeline
- `03_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md` - Current implementation status of all components

### System Components

- `components/`
  - `01_RESOURCE_SYSTEM.md` - Resource management and flow system
  - `02_EVENT_SYSTEM.md` - Event handling and subscription system
  - `03_CONTEXT_PROVIDERS.md` - Context providers and state management
  - `04_MANAGER_SERVICES.md` - Manager services and dependency injection
  - `05_MODULE_SYSTEM.md` - Module system and component registration
  - `06_EXPLORATION_SYSTEM.md` - Exploration and discovery system

### Implementation Phases

- `phases/`
  - `01_FOUNDATION.md` - Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis
  - `02_CORE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Phase 2: Core System Implementation
  - `03_MODULE_INTEGRATION.md` - Phase 3: Module-by-Module Integration
  - `04_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Phase 4: Performance Optimization and QA

### Testing and QA

- `testing/`
  - `01_TEST_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Test infrastructure and patterns
  - `02_UNIT_TESTING.md` - Unit testing guidelines and examples
  - `03_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md` - Integration testing guidelines and examples
  - `04_PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md` - Performance testing and benchmarking

## Usage Instructions

1. Start with `01_ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the core principles
2. Review `02_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` for the high-level project structure
3. Check `03_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md` for current implementation status
4. Navigate to specific component documentation as needed
5. Reference implementation phases for detailed task breakdowns
6. Consult testing documentation for QA guidelines

## Implementation Status

Current implementation progress can be found in `03_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`. This file is regularly updated to reflect the latest status of all components.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Each module should be documented in its own file
2. Follow the established documentation structure
3. Keep implementation details with their respective modules
4. Update the status dashboard when making changes
5. Include relevant code examples and type definitions
