   - Create templates for implementing standardized patterns

## Success Metrics

The success of the restructuring effort will be measured by:

1. **Type Safety:**

   - Reduction in TypeScript errors and `any` type usage
   - Consistency of type definitions across modules

2. **Component Connections:**

   - Percentage of UI components properly connected to backend services
   - Reliability of state updates in UI components
