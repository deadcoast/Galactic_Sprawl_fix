## Project Mapping Guidelines

- All paths are relative to project root
- Dependencies indicate direct relationships
- "Used By" indicates reverse dependencies
- All components should follow consistent naming
- Event systems should use centralized bus

- Event system implementation
- Resource management system
- Module framework

## Phase 2: Core Systems

- Combat system implementation
- Ship system implementation
- Resource tracking system
- Effect system implementation
- Automation system implementation

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript for all new code
- React for UI components
- RxJS for event handling
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- JSDoc for documentation

## Version Control

- Pull requests for code review
- Semantic versioning
- Conventional commits

## Documentation

- Code comments for complex logic
- JSDoc for public APIs
- README files for directories
- Architecture diagrams
- User documentation

## Performance Considerations

- Web workers for heavy computation
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Virtualization for large lists
- Code splitting for faster loading
- Lazy loading for non-critical components

## Security Considerations

- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure communication
- Error handling

## Accessibility Considerations

- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast
- Focus management
- Responsive design
