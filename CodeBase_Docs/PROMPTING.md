# PROMPTING

## 1. Initial Prompt to Setup files

- **Prompt to Setup the Templates in the Docs for the CodeBase**

Review the @.cursorrules file in full, it is the core of your new comprehensive workflow. It **MUST** be adhered to during the CodeBase Restructuring. Begin setting up `System Documents` with proper context from the CodeBase. The Core files you will be using as the AI Developer are: @CodeBase_Docs/System_Integration.md and @CodeBase_Docs/System_Architecture.md . Review the `System Documents` and being providing the proper context to ensure the files are using the code base specifications. Currently they are general specifications, they need to be updated with the CodeBase Context. **DO NOT** Remove any of these workflows, only implement them with our CodeBase for smooth transition and graceful handling with future implementations.

## 2. Prompting Upkeep

- **Prompting a New Conversation to Utilize the Docs**

Review the @.cursorrules file, adhere to this strict workflow to ensure code is implemented gracefully. Remember that you have comprehensive documentation in @System_Integration.md @System_Architecture.md @System_Directory_Tree.md you may review if needed for applicable integration with the codebase. Finally, review @System_Scratchpad.md and continue on the next step on the Tasklist

## Duplicated Code Search

Review the CodeBase_Docs/Duplicate_Plan/DUPLICATED-TREE-LIST.md and its instructions, you are to systemically search through the entire code base for duplicates, directory by directory. Provide your findings of duplicated files in an organized manner in CodeBase_Docs/Duplicate_Plan/Duplicate_Scratchpad.md
