# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

Your `.cursorrules` workflow is **MANDATORY** as follows.

1. Review the Scratchpad
2. Review the task
3. Plan the steps
4. Search codebase for existing implementations
5. Take action
6. Update the `Scratchpad` and `Lessons` sections

**YOU MUST ALWAYS SEARCH THE CODE BASE TO AVOID CREATING DUPLICATE IMPLEMENTATIONS.**

## Lessons

## Cursor Learned

### CRITICAL: Code Organization and Development

1. **ALWAYS SEARCH FOR EXISTING IMPLEMENTATIONS BEFORE CREATING NEW CODE**

   - Use file_search and codebase_search BEFORE writing any new component
   - Check all similar file names and paths thoroughly
   - Review existing implementations completely
   - NEVER create new files without verifying duplicates
   - If duplicate work is discovered, IMMEDIATELY fix it yourself
   - Take responsibility for your own mistakes and fix them immediately
   - Don't just identify problems - SOLVE them

2. **Type System Organization**

   - Keep core/base types in a central location (e.g., GameTypes.ts)
   - Use inheritance for shared properties (e.g., extending BaseStats)
   - Maintain clear type hierarchies (base -> specific -> component props)
   - Group related types together with clear section comments
   - Re-export types that are commonly used together
   - Use proper type imports from their source files
   - Pay attention to exact type names and values

3. **Similar Interface Management**
   - Keep interfaces separate if they truly serve different purposes
   - Use specific naming to indicate purpose (e.g., FactionWeaponEffect vs DebugWeaponEffect)
   - Document the purpose and differences between similar interfaces
   - Each interface should:
     - Have a clear, specific purpose
     - Live in the appropriate module
     - Use types relevant to its purpose
     - Be imported from a single source of truth

### Development Best Practices

- Add debug information to stderr while keeping stdout clean
- Handle lexical declarations in switch-case blocks using block scoping
- Remove unused imports to avoid TypeScript linter warnings
- Use 'as const' assertions to properly type string literals
- Properly handle cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks
- When implementing threshold-based systems, use proper TypeScript types and React Context
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8)
- Ensure proper event emission and handling across the system
- Maintain consistent type usage across related components
