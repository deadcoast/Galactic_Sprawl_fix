# .cursorrules 

This file contains all essential codebase patterns, structures, interfaces, and relationships.
Refer to this file first when seeking context for code generation, correction, or analysis.
BEGIN EVERY TASK BY CONSULTING .cursorcontext.md BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANY SOLUTION.

## Correction and Code Implementation Guidelines

### DO NOT
- Implement solutions based solely on existing code examples
- Skip documentation review even when similar patterns exist elsewhere
- Assume pattern consistency without verification
- Add wrapper functions around existing methods
- Alter existing functionality
- Create your own implementations of existing methods
- Make assumptions about the code - always verify first
- Create actual instances of real classes and use their existing methods directly
- Avoid creating new files when asked to correct a file

### REQUIRED STEPS
1. Search .cursorcontext.md for relevant system patterns using #hashtag identifiers
2. Document in Scratchpad which patterns were found and will be applied
3. Only after documentation review, proceed with implementation
4. Verify implementation against documented patterns before submission

## Workflow & Instructions

### Context Source:

`.cursorcontext.md` is the primary source of truth for code patterns, structures, interfaces, and relationships. Always refer to this file first when seeking context for code generation, correction, or analysis.

### Context Retrieval Process:
- When analyzing or generating code, first search `.cursorcontext` for relevant system sections using `(#hashtag)` identifiers
- Look for code patterns, interfaces, and type structures in the identified sections
- Verify implementation approaches against established patterns
- If context is insufficient, ask the user for clarification

### Architecture Alignment:
- Ensure all implementations follow patterns in `.cursorcontext`
- Maintain consistency with existing type structures and interfaces
- Follow established naming conventions and implementation patterns
- If context is missing, ask the user before implementing new patterns

### Incremental Implementation:
- Generate code in manageable steps aligned with patterns in `.cursorcontext`
- Review implementations for consistency with documented patterns
- Identify and resolve gaps between implementation and documentation

### Context Maintenance:
- When discovering new patterns or implementations, suggest updates to `.cursorcontext`
- Format new context entries according to the established structure
- Ensure new entries include concrete code examples, not explanations

## `Scratchpad` Tasklist Usage

Maintain a `Tasklist` in the Scratchpad section below in this format:

```
## Scratchpad

[X] Task 1 - Update progress markers as subtasks are completed
[ ] Task 2 - Use the Scratchpad to maintain implementation context and track progress
```

## Patterns Found in .cursorcontext.md

## Category 1: Unused Variables and Methods (406 instances)
- We are not removing these as the codebase is under active development and they will be integrated later.
- Added ESLint disable comments to analysis tools (consolidate.js and main.js) for unused variables without removing them.

## Category 2: Type Safety Issues (74 instances)
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Proper Type Definitions**
  - [ ] Create concrete type definitions to replace all 'any' types
  - [ ] Implement strict type checking across all components
  - [ ] Add proper generic implementations for container classes
  - [ ] Create type utilities for complex type relationships
  
  **Primary Files with Any Types:**
  - [ ] `src/utils/performance/D3BatchedUpdates.ts`: 25 instances of 'any' type usage
  - [ ] `src/types/visualizations/D3SelectionTypes.ts`: Multiple 'any' type usages in selection interfaces

## Category 3: Optional Chaining Errors (34 instances)
- [X] **Task 3: Implement Proper Null Checking**
  - [X] Fix ResourceFlowWorker.ts with proper null validation logic (line 143)
  - [X] Fix worker.ts with appropriate null-safe access patterns (line 31)
  - [ ] Implement proper error handlers for null conditions
  - [ ] Add validation functions to ensure data structures are complete before access

## Category 4: Console Statement Violations (23 instances)
- [X] **Task 4: Implement Structured Logging System**
  - [X] Create a centralized logging service with proper severity levels
  - [X] Replace console statements with structured logging calls (started with stateMigration.ts)
  - [ ] Implement environment-specific logging configuration
  - [ ] Add context information to all log messages

## Category 5: TypeScript Comment Violations (14 instances)
- [ ] **Task 5: Implement Proper Type Definitions for Ignored Cases**
  - [ ] Create proper interfaces for all @ts-ignore cases
  - [ ] Implement type utilities for complex type scenarios
  - [ ] Refactor code to properly handle edge cases with type safety
  - [ ] Create unit tests validating type correctness

## Category 6: Miscellaneous Issues (3 instances)
- [X] **Task 6: Fix Remaining Type and Immutability Issues**
  - [X] Implement proper typed object definitions
  - [X] Enforce immutability with proper readonly modifiers
  - [X] Create validation functions for complex type scenarios
  
  **Specific Issues:**
  - [X] Empty object type definitions (2 instances) - Fixed SystemOptions and ExtendedProps
  - [X] Non-const declaration (1 instance) - Fixed PI_VALUE in calculations.ts

## Category 7: Code Integration
- [ ] **Task 7: Complete System Integration**
  - [ ] Connect all implemented components to their respective systems
  - [ ] Implement all missing functionality in resource flow system
  - [ ] Complete event system implementation with proper type safety
  - [ ] Ensure full integration between worker system and main application

## Category 7: Code Integration Issues

### Key Integration Files:

#### src/workers/ResourceFlowWorker.ts
- Missing proper validation for incoming messages
- Insufficient error handling for worker communication
- No robust retry mechanism for failed operations
- Lacks proper typeguards for cross-thread messaging

#### src/workers/worker.ts
- Generic message handler without proper type checking
- No structured error reporting system
- Missing proper task scheduling and prioritization
- Insufficient task cancellation implementation

### Additional Integration Issues:
- Incomplete event system implementation in src/lib/events/
- Missing connections between resource system components
- Unfinished worker communication protocol
- Incomplete error propagation across system boundaries
