# ERROR CORRECTION

- **USE THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO CREATE A CONTEXTUALLY ACCURATE CORRECTION FOR THE ERRORS PROVIDED**

## FORMATTING - MANDITORY STANDARDS

- NO new dependencies if an existing one is available
- NO guessing or making assumptions about the codebase implementations
- NO streamlined or placeholder code generations.

## [1] Identify the purpose of the function in the error

- **IDENTIFY THE CONTEXTUAL IMPACT OF THE ERROR IN ITS IMPLEMENTED STATE**
- You should be searching for direct and indirect references to the function to ensure no duplicates are created, and that you are using the correct function name.
- Assess the impact of the error and the corresponding functions it affects for correction if required.
- Search for implementations affected by the error in other modules / code files.
- In many places, the codebase requires referencing or utilization of functions that are not yet implemented.

## [2] Consider the credibility of the correction you are planning to implement

- **Corrections must be planned accordingly, it must have thorough context of current codebase implementations, it must take the existing codebase into account.**
  - If new implementation is required, the codebase must be thoroughly searched for current implementation not yet implemented.
  - You should not create new files or functions, but rather modify existing ones.

## [3] Concluding steps and labels

- Based on the potential impact of the error and the credibility of the correction, the tasklist should be created in an ascending manner of HIGH -> MEDIUM -> LOW / PRIORITY of tasks that need to be completed first.
