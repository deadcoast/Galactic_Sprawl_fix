## Type System Issues

### Resource Type Inconsistencies

The most prevalent issue in the codebase is the inconsistent use of resource types. There are two competing implementations:

1. **String-based resource types** (e.g., `'minerals'`, `'energy'`)
2. **Enum-based resource types** (e.g., `ResourceType.MINERALS`, `ResourceType.ENERGY`)

This inconsistency leads to type errors when components using different implementations try to interact. The errors manifest as:

```typescript
Type '"minerals"' is not assignable to type 'ResourceType'. Did you mean 'ResourceType.MINERALS'?
```

**Affected Files:**

- `src/components/exploration/AdvancedFilteringDemo.tsx` (multiple TS2820 errors)
- `src/components/exploration/ResourceDiscoveryDemo.tsx`
- `src/components/exploration/visualizations/AnalysisVisualization.tsx`
- `src/components/core/SystemIntegration.tsx` (multiple TS2551 errors)
- Many colony management components

**Error Counts:**

- 119 TS2820 errors (Type X is not assignable to type Y)
- 17 TS2551 errors (Property X does not exist on type Y. Did you mean Z?)
- 1086 ESLint warnings for string resource types

**Root Cause:**

The codebase has two separate resource type definitions:

- `src/types/resources/ResourceTypes.ts` (string-based)
- `src/types/resources/StandardizedResourceTypes.ts` (enum-based)

Components import from different files, leading to type incompatibilities. Additionally, many components are trying to import from StandardizedResourceTypes.ts which cannot be found (51 TS2307 errors).

**Solution:**

1. Consolidate resource type definitions into a single file
2. Standardize on enum-based ResourceType
3. Create migration utilities for string-to-enum conversion
4. Update all components to use the standardized types

### Missing Properties in Manager Classes

Many components expect properties that don't exist on the objects they're using:

```typescript
Property 'on' does not exist on type 'ShipHangarManager'.
Property 'emit' does not exist on type 'FactionBehaviorEventEmitter'.
```

**Affected Components:**

- `src/components/buildings/modules/hangar/ShipHangar.tsx`
- `src/components/buildings/modules/hangar/StandardShipHangar.tsx`
- `src/hooks/combat/useCombatAI.ts`
- `src/hooks/factions/useFactionBehavior.ts`

**Error Counts:**

- 383 TS2339 errors (Property does not exist on type)

**Root Cause:**

The codebase has inconsistent event handling patterns:

- Some managers use EventEmitter with on/off/emit methods
- Others use custom event handling with different method names
- Some components expect event methods that aren't implemented

**Solution:**

1. Create a standardized EventEmitter base class
2. Update all manager classes to implement the standard interface
3. Add missing event methods to manager classes
4. Update components to use the standardized event methods

### Any Type Usage

The codebase has extensive use of the `any` type, which bypasses TypeScript's type checking:

```typescript
function processData(data: any) { ... }
const result: any = getData();
```

**Affected Areas:**

- Visualization components
- Chart renderers
- UI components
- Type utilities

**Error Counts:**

- 18 TS7031 errors (Binding element implicitly has an 'any' type)

**Root Cause:**

The `any` type is often used as a shortcut to avoid proper typing, especially for:

- Complex visualization data structures
- External library integrations
- Event handlers with unknown payloads

**Solution:**

1. Replace `any` with more specific types (`unknown`, generic types)
2. Create proper interfaces for complex data structures
3. Use type guards for runtime type checking
4. Implement generic type utilities for common patterns

## Code Structure Issues

### Unused Variables and Imports

The codebase has many unused variables and imports:

```typescript
import { Unused } from './module'; // Never used
const value = getValue(); // Never used
```

**Affected Areas:**

- Throughout the codebase

**Error Counts:**

- 367 TS6133 errors (Variable is declared but its value is never read)
- 289 ESLint warnings for unused variables

**Root Cause:**

Unused variables and imports often result from:

- Code refactoring without cleanup
- Commented-out functionality
- Over-importing from modules

**Solution:**

1. Remove unused imports
2. Prefix unused variables with underscore (\_variableName)
3. Clean up commented-out code
4. Use more specific imports (import { specific } from './module')

### Module Resolution Issues

Many components are trying to import from modules that cannot be found:

```typescript
Cannot find module '../../types/resources/StandardizedResourceTypes' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

**Affected Areas:**

- Components trying to use StandardizedResourceTypes.ts

**Error Counts:**

- 51 TS2307 errors (Cannot find module or its corresponding type declarations)

**Root Cause:**

- The file path may be incorrect
- The file may have been moved or renamed
- The file may not exist in the expected location

**Solution:**

1. Create the missing StandardizedResourceTypes.ts file
2. Update import paths to point to the correct location
3. Consolidate with ResourceTypes.ts to avoid duplication

## Specific Component Issues

### ShipHangar Component

The ShipHangar component has multiple issues:

1. Missing event methods on ShipHangarManager
2. Implicit 'any' types in event handlers
3. Duplicate JSX attributes
4. Type comparison issues with ShipStatus

**Root Cause:**

The component was likely developed against an earlier version of ShipHangarManager that had different methods or was using a different event system.

**Solution:**

1. Update ShipHangarManager to implement proper event methods
2. Add proper typing to event handlers
3. Fix duplicate JSX attributes
4. Use proper type comparisons for ShipStatus

### ResourceDiscoveryDemo Component

The ResourceDiscoveryDemo component has type compatibility issues with ResourceDiscovery and ResourceData types.

**Root Cause:**

The component is using types from both ResourceTypes.ts and StandardizedResourceTypes.ts, leading to incompatible type definitions.

**Solution:**

1. Update the component to use standardized resource types
2. Fix type definitions for ResourceDiscovery and ResourceData
3. Add type guards for backward compatibility

### SystemIntegration Component

The SystemIntegration component has multiple property access issues:

```typescript
Property 'minerals' does not exist on type 'Record<ResourceType, ResourceState>'. Did you mean 'MINERALS'?
```

**Root Cause:**

The component is using lowercase property names (minerals) when the enum-based keys are uppercase (MINERALS).

**Solution:**

1. Update property access to use enum values (ResourceType.MINERALS)
2. Use computed property access syntax (resources[ResourceType.MINERALS])
3. Add helper methods for accessing resources by type

## Recommendations

   - Group related imports
   - Sort imports consistently
