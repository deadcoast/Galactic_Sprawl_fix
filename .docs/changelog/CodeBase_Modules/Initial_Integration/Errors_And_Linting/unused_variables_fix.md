# Unused Variables in Test Utilities (July 15, 2023)

## Error

Linting errors related to unused variables in test utility files:

1. `'resourceType' is defined but never used` in `src/tests/utils/fixtureUtils.ts`
2. Incorrect property names in type definitions causing type errors

## Cause

The `createResourceState` function in `fixtureUtils.ts` accepted a `resourceType` parameter but didn't use it in the function body. Additionally, when attempting to fix this by adding type-specific defaults, incorrect property names were used (`capacity` instead of `max`).

## Solution

1. Made the `resourceType` parameter meaningful by using it to provide type-specific defaults:

   ```typescript
   export function createResourceState(
     resourceType: ResourceType,
     overrides: Partial<typeof resourceStates.standard> = {}
   ) {
     // Apply resource-specific defaults based on type
     const typeDefaults: Record<ResourceType, Partial<typeof resourceStates.standard>> = {
       minerals: { production: 10, consumption: 5, max: 1000, current: 100, min: 0 },
       energy: { production: 20, consumption: 15, max: 2000, current: 200, min: 0 },
       // ... other resource types
     };

     return {
       ...resourceStates.standard,
       ...typeDefaults[resourceType],
       ...overrides,
     };
   }
   ```

2. Ensured that all property names matched the `ResourceState` interface definition:
   - Used `max` instead of `capacity`
   - Included all required properties: `current`, `max`, `min`, `production`, `consumption`

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check interface definitions when working with typed objects
2. When fixing unused variables, consider if they were intended to be used but the implementation was incomplete
3. Make parameters meaningful rather than removing them if they provide context or could be useful
4. Document the approach to handling unused variables for future reference
