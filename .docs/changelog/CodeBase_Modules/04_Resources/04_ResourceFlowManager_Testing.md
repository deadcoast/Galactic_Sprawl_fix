# ResourceFlowManager Testing Implementation

Comprehensive tests have been added for the ResourceFlowManager to ensure its robustness and reliability. These tests cover various aspects of the manager's functionality:

## 1. Cache System Testing (`ResourceFlowManager.cache.test.ts`)

Tests focus on ensuring the caching mechanism works correctly:

### Caching Retrieval and Updating

- Resource states are properly cached on first retrieval
- Cached states are returned when requested again within TTL
- New states are returned after cache invalidation

### Cache Expiration

- Cache entries expire based on TTL
- Cache is invalidated when registering a node with affected resource type
- Unrelated resource types remain cached when other types are invalidated

### Cache Isolation

- State objects are cloned to prevent reference modification issues

## 2. Batch Processing (`ResourceFlowManager.batch.test.ts`)

Tests verify that batch processing functionality works correctly for large networks:

- Processing nodes in batches according to batch size
- Handling converters in batches
- Processing connections in batches
- Network efficiency with different batch sizes

## 3. Error Handling and Edge Cases (`ResourceFlowManager.errors.test.ts`)

Tests ensure the system is robust under various conditions:

### Input Validation

- Rejection of invalid nodes
- Rejection of invalid connections
- Rejection of invalid flows

### Edge Cases

- Empty networks
- Networks with no active nodes
- Resource states with zero or negative values
- Circular dependencies

### Error Recovery

- Recovery from failed transfers
- Handling resource state changes during optimization

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Isolation**: Each test file focuses on a specific aspect of the ResourceFlowManager functionality.
2. **Comprehensiveness**: Tests cover nominal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
3. **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked to isolate the ResourceFlowManager during testing.
4. **Performance**: Tests for batch processing validate that performance optimizations work correctly.
5. **Robustness**: Error handling and recovery tests ensure the system can handle unexpected conditions.

## Test Coverage

These tests provide high coverage of the ResourceFlowManager's functionality:

- Constructor and initialization
- Node and connection registration/unregistration
- Resource state management
- Caching mechanism
- Batch processing
- Flow optimization
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## Test Implementation Details

### Mock Strategy

The following parts are mocked in tests:

```typescript
vi.mock('../../../utils/resources/resourceValidation', () => ({
  validateResourceFlow: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => true),
  validateResourceTransfer: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => true),
}));
```

### Cache Tests

Mock Date.now to control time in tests:

```typescript
// Mock Date.now for testing cache expiration
let currentTime = 0;
const originalDateNow = Date.now;

beforeEach(() => {
  currentTime = 1000;
  Date.now = vi.fn(() => currentTime);
});

afterEach(() => {
  Date.now = originalDateNow;
});
```

### Error Tests

Tests manipulate mock return values to simulate failures:

```typescript
// Mock validateResourceTransfer to simulate failures
vi.mocked(validateResourceTransfer).mockImplementation(() => false);
```

## Best Practices Identified

Through test development, these best practices were identified:

1. Use small batch sizes for batch processing unit tests to reduce test execution time
2. Mock time-dependent functionality for deterministic tests
3. Test edge cases with extreme values to verify robust error handling
4. Verify inputs are validated before operations
5. Ensure cache isolation to prevent data leakage
6. Test recovery from error conditions to ensure system resilience

## Future Test Improvements

Potential future improvements to the test suite:

1. Add property-based testing for edge cases
2. Implement performance benchmarks to detect regressions
3. Add integration tests with UI components
4. Create stress tests for large resource networks
5. Add fuzz testing for resource state changes
