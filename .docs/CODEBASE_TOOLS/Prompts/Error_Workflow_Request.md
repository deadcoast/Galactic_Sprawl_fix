run a full system analysis on errors, Create a workflow so we may better understand the errors in the codebase, I want to:

1. Analyze the entire application for errors
2. Categorize the errors in a structured markdown file in a manner that best suits correction and integration. This file should be automatically created and structured, this file should display type script conflicts aswell as errors. Add additions to this structure that will best suit error correction.
3. review the old @March10_Error_Archive format of the error correction workflow. This did not work well, you must create a more effecient and organized structure in @March17_Error_Directory .
4. Ensure any scripts are created in this directory, do not place them in the applications codebase. This needs to be organized and isolated to find easily. The workflow must include a README.md for any scripts, how to activate them, what commands to run, what they do. This will ensure a consistent error correction in the future.
