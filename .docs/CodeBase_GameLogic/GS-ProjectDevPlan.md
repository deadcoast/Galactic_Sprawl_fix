# Galactic Sprawl Development Roadmap

This roadmap is organized into clear phases and sections to guide you step-by-step through development—from the initial project setup to advanced gameplay systems and late-game scaling. Use this as your “development-only” blueprint (excluding testing and release/rollout) to ensure every required asset and mechanic is built in the proper order.

> **Objective:** Build a complete and cohesive game by following these development phases, starting with the simplest core elements (e.g., the Mothership and Tier 1 modules) and layering on more advanced systems (e.g., Tech Tree, automation, enemy AI, and late-game structures).

## 1. Project Skeleton & Core Setup

**Goal:** Establish the game’s foundational structure and set up the initial project environment.

- **Create a New Project:**

  - Set up an initial “Gameplay” scene/world with the Mothership as the central hub.
  - Prepare the base **Main Menu UI** for empire naming and banner creation.
  - Create at least one **Game World** (the “local system”) where the Mothership is placed.

- **Empire Naming & Banner Creation:**

  - **UI Input:** Add a text field for players to enter an empire name.
  - **Dynamic Text:** Replace placeholders (e.g., `{Galactic_Sprawl}`) with the chosen empire name throughout the UI.
  - **Banner Selection:** Implement a sprite selection or color customization tool for banners.

- **Basic Camera & Player Control:**
  - Establish a stationary camera view centered on the Mothership.
  - Add interactive camera actions (e.g., zooming into specific assets like the Colony Star Port).
  - Ensure the scene is large enough for future expansions (star stations, ships, etc.).

_At the end of this phase, you will have a fundamental game shell: Menu → Empire Naming → Initial Game World with the central Mothership._

## 2. HUD, Maps & UI Views

This section covers all on-screen UI elements and interactive maps that form the player’s interface to the game’s mechanics. Each subsection explains design, implementation techniques, and recommended third-party libraries using TypeScript, React, and .tsx.

### 2.1 Default VPR UI View - [[GS_MV-VisualProgressRepresentationUIView]]

**Purpose:** Consolidate all Visual Progression Representation (VPR) assets into a cohesive “Star System Screen” that dynamically shows the current state of the star system.

- **Core Visual Components:**

  - **Star System Backdrop:**
    - Create a parallax star background (using CSS effects or [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for 3D).
    - _Library Suggestion:_ [react-parallax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax)
  - **Central Mothership VPR:**
    - Render as the central, evolving structure with animations (use SVG or [react-konva](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/)).
    - Add hover effects and click interactivity for detailed stats or upgrades.
  - **Colony Star Station, Habitable World, Exploration Hub, Mineral Processing Centre, Officer Academy & Ship Hanger VPRs:**
    - Each component should have its own animations and interactive elements (e.g., easing animations via [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) or [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)).
  - **Additional VPR Elements:**
    - Visual cues for population, trade routes, and upgrade transitions (using [react-particles-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles-js) or GSAP for complex sequences).

- **Component Architecture & Technical Implementation:**

  - **Hierarchy:** A top-level `<VPRStarSystemView />` with child components for each module.
  - **State Management:** Use React Context/Redux for global state (tier levels, resource counts) and local state for individual animations.
  - **Styling & Responsiveness:** Utilize CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components) for consistent themes (dark backgrounds, cyan accents).

- **Implementation Summary:**
  - Integrate dynamic data to update visuals in real time.
  - Optimize performance with memoization and lazy loading.
  - Include interactive hooks (hover, click, hotkeys) for a seamless player experience.

- **Scrolling & Custom Scrollbars:**

  - Wrap overflow content in a scrollable container.
  - _Library Suggestion:_ [react-scrollbars-custom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrollbars-custom) for a custom-styled scrollbar (cyan thumb on a dark track).

- **Keyboard Shortcuts & Interactivity:**
  - Integrate hotkeys (e.g., **S** for toggling the Civilization Sprawl View) using [react-hotkeys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys).
  - Enhance UI responsiveness with smooth transition animations (via [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) or [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)).
