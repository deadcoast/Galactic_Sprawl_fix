# Global Implementation & Best Practices

## Global State Management

- **Approach**:
  - Use Redux or the React Context API with the `useReducer` hook to manage global UI states (which view is active, resource counts, open/closed submenus, etc.).
- **Example**:
  - Create a `UIContext` that holds the current view (HUD, Galaxy Map, Tech Tree, etc.) and functions to toggle views.

## Animation & Transitions

- **Libraries**:
  - [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) are ideal for animating menu transitions, expanding modules, and zoom effects on maps.
- **Techniques**:
  - Use keyframe animations for persistent background effects (e.g., parallax scrolling).
  - Implement easing functions for smoother interactions.

## Responsive & Themed Design

- **Styling**:
  - Use CSS-in-JS solutions (like styled-components or Emotion) to create reusable, themed components.
  - Define a theme with consistent colors (e.g., dark backgrounds, cyan highlights) and fonts that match the sci-fi aesthetic.
- **Responsive Techniques**:
  - Utilize media queries and flexbox/grid layouts to ensure that UI assets adapt to different screen sizes.

## Keyboard & Mouse Interactions

- **Hotkeys**:
  - Integrate [react-hotkeys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys) for keyboard shortcuts (e.g., S to toggle Sprawl View, M for Galaxy Map).
- **Tooltips & Modals**:
  - Use lightweight libraries such as [react-tooltip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tooltip) or custom modal components to provide additional information without cluttering the interface.

## Summary

This expanded Section 2 document consolidates every UI asset and VPR view for _Galactic Sprawl_. It details:

- The **Global HUD** and organized submenu system with custom scrollbars and hotkey integration.
- The **Civilization Sprawl View** with layered visuals (parallax backgrounds, glowing markers, animated trade routes) and interactive features.
- The **Tech Tree UI** with three tier columns, node interactivity, and progress indicators.
- The **Local Galaxy Map** with dynamic layouts, zoom/pan controls, and travel/colonization mechanics.
- The individual UIs for the **Mothership Build Menu**, **Colony Star Station Map**, **Exploration Hub**, **Mineral Processing Centre**, **Officer Academy**, **Ship Hanger**, **Habitable World**, and **Experience/Leveling**.
- Best practices for global state management, animations, responsive design, and interactivity using recommended third-party libraries.
