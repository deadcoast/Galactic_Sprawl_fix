  - [x] PROMPT USER TO REVIEW STEP 2 FOR APPROVAL.

- [x] **Step 3: Add ui data to `GS-USER-INTERFACE-REFERENCE.md`**

  - [x] Understand the context and purpose behind creating new notepads. Refer to `/src/.cursor/notepad-documentation.md` for guidance.
  - [x] Include relevant UI implementation details, references, and best practices within this new notepad.
  - [x] Update related GS notepads such as `@GS-CONTEXT-COMMANDS` and `@GS-REFERENCE-TAGS-SYSTEM` to reflect new UI references.
  - [x] PROMPT USER TO REVIEW STEP 3 FOR APPROVAL.

- [x] **Step 4: Create the Rules File `user-interface.mdc`**
  - [x] `REVIEW` `src/.cursor/rules-documentation.md` and `src/.cursor/rules-guide.md` to ensure proper understanding of the project's rules system.
  - [x] Define UI-specific rules, guidelines, and best practices for the project (e.g., naming conventions, file structures, coding standards).
  - [x] Integrate the findings from the UI directory `REVIEW` to ensure consistency and alignment with existing rules.
  - [x] Update related GS notepads such as `@GS-CONTEXT-COMMANDS` and `@GS-REFERENCE-TAGS-SYSTEM` to reflect new UI references.
