# Unified Automation Sections for Galactic Sprawl

## Automation Terminology

**Automation Purpose (AP):**  
Each asset in Galactic Sprawl has an associated Automation Purpose that defines how it behaves autonomously:

- **War:**

  - **Behavior:** Automatically attack/defend when enemies are detected.
  - **Example:** War ships dispatch from hangers to intercept enemy vessels without direct input.

- **Recon:**

  - **Behavior:** Automates exploration and discovery.
  - **Example:** Recon ships systematically map galaxies, uncover anomalies, and identify new resources or habitable worlds.

- **Mining:**
  - **Behavior:** Automates resource extraction and processing.
  - **Example:** Mining ships automatically scan asteroid belts and extract materials based on set thresholds.

## In-Game Automated Processes (Extracted from Your Project)

- **Per-System Progress:**

  - **Independent Operation:** Each system retains its own state (resources, colonies, ships).
  - **Background Resource Generation:** As systems develop, population and resource metrics increase automatically.
  - **Return Persistence:** When a player revisits a system, all automated progress (upgrades, ships, station modules) remains as previously set.

- **Automated Development & Expansion:**

  - **Auto-Colonization:** Advanced systems (via tech tree research/TTR) trigger colonization of nearby star systems automatically.
  - **Food Synthesis/Biodome Crops:** Enhance both colony and habitable world growth without direct input.
  - **Trade Routes Formation:** Automated trade routes form based on system connectivity, visualized by increasing particle density along high-traffic corridors.

- **Mothership & Colony Star Station:**

  - **Automated Resource Sharing:** Automatically distribute resources between hubs.
  - **Auto-Upgrades & Notifications:** Modules (like Radar and Ship Hanger) provide real-time status, auto-producing ships or triggering alerts when enemy threats are detected.

- **Ship Hanger:**

  - **Auto-Production:** Queued ship builds are produced and dispatched automatically, with War Ships (e.g., Spitflares) intercepting enemies as soon as threats are detected.

- **Officer Academy:**

  - **Auto-Assignment:** Automatically assigns trained officers to fleets; officers level up via XP from automated tasks.

- **Mineral Processing Centre:**

  - **Threshold-Based Mining:** Once set thresholds (minimum/maximum resource levels) are reached, Mining Ships start or stop extraction automatically.
  - **Master “MINE ALL” Toggle:** Overrides individual settings for full-scale automated mining.

- **Exploration Hub:**

  - **Automated Recon Dispatch:** Recon ships are continuously deployed to explore unmapped regions, detect anomalies, and gather exploration data.

- **Automated Fleet Behavior:**
  - **War Ships:** Automatically engage enemies based on upgraded Radar alerts.
  - **Recon & Mining Ships:** Automatically traverse star systems—recon mapping unknown areas and mining ships scanning asteroid fields and processing resources.

## Vision & Objectives

**Overall Aim:**  
Develop a self-sustaining, ever-evolving galaxy where star systems, fleets, and modules operate autonomously in the background. The game world continuously grows and interacts (via auto-colonization, auto-trade routes, and automated combat/exploration) even when the player isn’t directly controlling every unit.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Per-System Progress:**  
  Each star system (from your Mothership to Colony Star Stations, Habitable Worlds, etc.) maintains its own resources, population, and upgrades. When the player returns, the system reflects its evolved state.

- **Automated Development:**  
  Systems automatically trigger processes such as:

  - **Auto-Colonization:** When thresholds (population, resource levels, or tech tiers) are reached, adjacent systems can be colonized automatically.
  - **Dynamic Trade Routes:** Automatically form between systems to share resources and boost growth.
  - **Background Operations:** Modules like the Mineral Processing Centre, Ship Hanger, and Recon/Mining ship dispatch work continuously, following preset priority rules.

- **Visual Feedback & Upgrades:**  
  Automated visual cues (e.g., pulsing planets, expanding Ship Hanger modules, glowing trade routes) indicate that upgrades and autonomous behaviors are in effec

## Integration into the React/TypeScript Architecture

### Component Structure & State Management

- **Component Hierarchy:**

  - **Top-Level Container:** `<VPRStarSystemView />` acts as the parent, hosting all automated modules (Mothership, Colony Station, Habitable Worlds, etc.).
  - **Child Components:** Each module (e.g., `<MothershipVPR />`, `<ShipHangerVPR />`, `<ExplorationHubVPR />`) controls its own automation logic, animations, and interactions.

- **State Strategy:**
  - **Global State (Redux/Context):** Maintain overall game data (resources, tech tree progress, production queues) that drive automated processes.
  - **Local State:** Each component handles its own animation triggers and periodic updates.
  - **Complex Flows:** Use state machines (with XState) for multi-stage automation sequences (e.g., auto-colonization steps or upgrade chains).

### Scheduling & Recurring Updates

- **Automation Scheduling:**  
  Integrate custom scheduling (via Redux-Saga/Thunk or custom React hooks) to trigger background updates (resource generation, fleet dispatch, trade route updates) without conflicting with your current code.

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  Use lazy loading (React.lazy) and memoization (React.memo) to ensure that automated elements do not impact overall performance.

## Automated Growth & Expansion

### Per-System Progress

- **Independent Operation:**  
  Each star system (whether it is the Mothership, Colony Star Station, or a Habitable World) holds its own resources, colonies, and ship fleets. Once the player leaves a system, it continues to operate in the background—mining, trading, and developing—without further manual intervention.

### Automated Development & Expansion

- **Auto-Colonization:**  
  As a system grows (in population, resources, or via tech tree upgrades), it can automatically colonize nearby star systems if advanced enough.
- **Accelerated Growth Mechanisms:**  
  Elements such as Food Synthesis or “Biodome Crops” accelerate both colony and habitable world development without direct player input.
- **Dynamic Trade Routes:**  
  Automatic trade routes form between connected systems, sharing resources and boosting local progress.

### Persistence & Return

- **State Saving:**  
  When a player revisits a system, the previously automated changes (ships, starports, upgrades, and other developments) are loaded exactly as left.
