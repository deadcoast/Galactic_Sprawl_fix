## Combat Automation & Engagement Logic

- **Detection & Engagement:**
  - Utilize the Radar system to flag enemy presence. When a threat is detected, war ships automatically switch from patrol to intercept mode.
  - Script engagement ranges and target-selection algorithms to determine when and how ships engage or retreat.
- **Combat Modes:**

  - Provide options for different engagement tactics (e.g., defensive, aggressive, evasive).
  - Program ships to coordinate with allied units, forming formations and executing group maneuvers.

- **Automated Engagement:**

- **Radar Integration:**

  - Ships are connected to the radar system, which continuously monitors for enemy presence within a defined engagement range.
  - When an enemy is detected, the automation system triggers an alert, and available ships are dispatched based on proximity and current operational status.

- **Engagement Protocols:**

  - **Target Acquisition:** Ships automatically select targets based on threat levels, distance, and ship type.
  - **Firing Sequences:** Once a target is engaged, the ship cycles through its weapon systems, prioritizing those with optimal range and damage profiles.
  - **Defensive Maneuvers:** Ships can automatically perform evasive actions or regroup into formations (such as V-formations) for coordinated attacks if multiple vessels are engaged.

- **Tactical Formations and Coordination:**

  - Capital ships (like the Midway Carrier) act as command centers, coordinating the movements and firing patterns of nearby warships.
  - Automated coordination ensures that ships maintain optimal formation distances, cover vulnerable flanks, and concentrate fire on high-value targets.

- **Automation Benefits:**

- Reduces micromanagement by allowing the AI to handle combat engagements.
- Adjusts real-time based on battlefield conditions, ensuring that the player’s fleet operates cohesively even during chaotic battles.
- Provides a smooth transition between manual strategy and automated execution, preserving strategic oversight while handling the heavy lifting of combat operations.

- **Combat HUD Indicators:**
  - Display targeting reticles, engagement ranges, and health/shield status during combat.
- **AI Tactical Behavior:**
  - Develop AI scripts for enemy and allied ships to dynamically react to battlefield conditions, including flanking, cover-seeking, and coordinated attacks.
- **Post-Combat Feedback:**
  - Integrate salvage and repair mechanics; destroyed enemy ships might drop salvageable components or trigger resource bonuses.

     - [ ] Implement bullet behavior (projectile speed, damage, collision detection, AoE triggers).
     - [ ] Integrate distinct visual and audio effects (muzzle flashes, projectile colors).
     - [ ] Configure automated targeting systems to select optimal weapons.
     - [ ] Consider additional defensive systems (e.g., point-defense lasers) and custom loadout options.
     - [ ] Implement physics-based interactions (realistic trajectories, damage falloffs).

4. **Combat Automation & Engagement Logic**

   - [ ] **Automated Engagement:**
     - [ ] Integrate radar systems for continuous enemy detection.
     - [ ] Auto-switch ships from patrol to intercept mode upon threat detection.
     - [ ] Implement target acquisition algorithms based on threat levels, distance, and ship type.
     - [ ] Define firing sequences that cycle through weapon systems based on combat conditions.
   - [ ] **Tactical Coordination & Defensive Maneuvers:**
     - [ ] Capital ships (e.g., Midway Carrier) coordinate allied formations.
     - [ ] Automate evasive actions and regrouping (e.g., V-formations).
   - [ ] **Post-Combat Operations:**
     - [ ] Implement salvage mechanics for collecting resources from destroyed enemy ships.
     - [ ] Enable auto-repair routines on capital ships.
   - [ ] **UI & Adaptive AI:**
     - [ ] Display HUD indicators (targeting reticles, engagement ranges, health/shield status).
     - [ ] Implement adaptive AI to modify formation spacing, target priorities, and retreat thresholds.
     - [ ] Coordinate multi-ship maneuvers (flanking, coordinated barrages).

5. **Specialized Recon & Mining Ships**

   - [ ] **Recon Ships – AC27G “Andromeda Cutter”:**
     - [ ] Role: Fast, stealth recon vessel for mapping and enemy detection.
     - [ ] Capabilities: Advanced sensor arrays, cloaking, XP gain from exploration.
     - [ ] Automation: Auto-dispatch from the Exploration Hub to unmapped regions, update global maps, adjust stealth based on enemy proximity.
     - [ ] Provide upgrade paths (e.g., faster mapping, limited defensive fire).
   - [ ] **Mining Ships – Void Dredger:**
     - [ ] Role: Specialized deep-space resource extraction vessel.
     - [ ] Capabilities: Heavy mining lasers, resource processing modules.
     - [ ] Automation: Monitor resource node levels; auto-dispatch to sites with low resources; deposit materials to Mineral Processing Centre; update resource counts with visual depletion cues.
     - [ ] Provide upgrade paths (e.g., improved extraction rates, yield efficiency).
   - [ ] **Global Rules for Recon & Mining:**
     - [ ] Recon ships auto-dispatched from the Exploration Hub.
     - [ ] Mining ships auto-dispatched from the Mineral Processing Centre.
     - [ ] Allow filtering and prioritizing resources in the Mining Map UI.

6. **Faction Variants & Additional Combat Enhancements**
   - [ ] **Faction-Based Customizations:**
     - [ ] Develop unique enemy factions (Space Rats, Lost Nova, Equator Horizon) with distinct ship designs, weapon loadouts, and AI tactics.
     - [ ] Implement visual markers (color schemes, insignias) for enemy ships.
     - [ ] Enable allied support vessels to auto-deploy based on expansion/alliances.
   - [ ] **Environmental & Battlefield Factors:**
     - [ ] Introduce dynamic hazards (asteroid fields, debris, cosmic anomalies) that affect movement and targeting.
     - [ ] Automate adjustments to engagement tactics based on environmental conditions.
   - [ ] **Salvage & Repair Systems:**
     - [ ] Auto-collect salvageable resources from destroyed enemy ships.
     - [ ] Enable capital ships to run integrated auto-repair routines.
   - [ ] **Adaptive AI Tactics:**
     - [ ] Dynamically modify formation spacing, target priorities, and retreat thresholds.
     - [ ] Coordinate multi-ship maneuvers (flanking, coordinated barrages) for maximum combat effectiveness.
