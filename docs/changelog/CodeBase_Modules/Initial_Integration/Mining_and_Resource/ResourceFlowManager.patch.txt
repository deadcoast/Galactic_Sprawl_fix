## Fix for TypeScript Error in MiningResourceIntegration.ts

The issue is that you're using a method `getNode()` on the `ResourceFlowManager` class, but this method doesn't exist in the class. However, the `getNodes()` method does exist.

To fix this issue, you need to add the missing `getNode()` method to the `ResourceFlowManager` class:

1. Open `src/managers/resource/ResourceFlowManager.ts`
2. Find the `getNodes()` method (around line 2305)
3. Add the following code just before the `getNodes()` method:

```typescript
  /**
   * Get node by ID
   * 
   * @param id The ID of the node to retrieve
   * @returns The flow node with the specified ID, or undefined if not found
   */
  public getNode(id: string): FlowNode | undefined {
    return this.network.nodes.get(id);
  }
```

This method will retrieve a single node by its ID, which is what your code in `MiningResourceIntegration.ts` is trying to do.

Alternatively, as a temporary fix, you can modify the two places in `MiningResourceIntegration.ts` to use the existing `getNodes()` method and filter the results:

```typescript
// Instead of:
const node = this.flowManager.getNode(`mining-ship-${ship.id}`);

// Use:
const node = this.flowManager.getNodes().find(n => n.id === `mining-ship-${ship.id}`);
```

However, adding the `getNode()` method to `ResourceFlowManager` would be a more efficient and cleaner solution.
