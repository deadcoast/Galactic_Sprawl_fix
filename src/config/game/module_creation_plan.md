# MODULE CREATION PLAN

Here's a comprehensive plan and task list to recreate these files. We'll do this step-by-step, creating foundational content for each file.

Overall Plan:

Determine Purpose: Infer the likely purpose of each file based on its name and location within the src directory structure.

Identify Core Content: Define the essential types, interfaces, constants, functions, or components expected in files of that nature within your project's context.

Consult Context/Rules: Leverage the .cursorrules and the existing file structure (src_code_tree.md) to guide the structure and content, ensuring consistency with your project's patterns.

Generate Foundational Code: Create each file with basic, essential content. For types, define common structures. For config, create a basic object. For the behavior tree, define core classes/enums. For the page, create a basic React component structure.

Iterative Refinement (Post-Creation): After the files are created, we (or you) will likely need to refine them by:

- Searching the codebase for identifiers (types, functions, constants) that should reside in these files.
- Adding necessary imports/exports.
- Integrating them correctly with other modules.

Tasklist for File Recreation:

- [x] **Task F1: Recreate `src/types/common.ts`**
  - [x] Define common basic types (e.g., ID, Timestamp).
  - [x] Define common utility types if patterns are known.
  - [x] Define simple, widely used enums (e.g., Status).
  - [x] _Avoid redefining types clearly belonging elsewhere (like `Position` from `core`)._
- [x] **Task F2: Recreate `src/types/index.ts` (Barrel File)**
  - [x] List directories/files within `src/types`.
  - [x] Generate `export * from '...'` or `export type { ... } from '...'` statements for relevant type files/directories.
- [x] **Task F3: Recreate `src/config/game/gameConfig.ts`**
  - [x] Define an exported constant object `gameConfig`.
  - [x] Add placeholder fields for common game settings (e.g., `initialResources`, `difficultySettings`, `worldSize`, `tickRate`).
- [x] **Task F4: Recreate `src/lib/ai/behaviorTree.ts`**
  - [x] Define a `Status` enum (`SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RUNNING`).
  - [x] Define a base `Node` abstract class or interface with a `tick` method.
  - [x] Define basic composite node classes (`Sequence`, `Selector`) inheriting from `Node`.
  - [x] Define a base `LeafNode` class.
  - [x] Define placeholder `ActionNode` and `ConditionNode` classes inheriting from `LeafNode`.
- [x] **Task F5: Recreate `src/pages/ConverterManagementPage.tsx`**
  - [x] Create a basic React functional component structure (`export function ConverterManagementPage() { ... }`).
  - [x] Add placeholder `useState` for relevant data (e.g., converters list).
  - [x] Add placeholder `useEffect` for fetching data (e.g., from `ResourceConversionManager`).
  - [x] Add basic JSX structure using common UI components (e.g., layout, titles, potentially referencing `ConverterDashboard.tsx` structure).
  - [x] Add necessary imports (React, hooks, potentially manager/UI components).

## Next Steps: Refinement and Integration

The foundational files have been recreated, but they require significant refinement to match the original functionality and integrate properly.

- [ ] **Task N1: Refine `src/types/common.ts`**
  - [ ] Search codebase for common types that should reside here (e.g., specific status enums, utility types).
  - [ ] Add any missing widely used interfaces or type aliases.
  - [ ] Verify `Vector2D`/`Vector3D` don't conflict with `src/types/core/Position.ts` and adjust/import as needed.
- [ ] **Task N2: Refine `src/types/index.ts`**
  - [ ] Verify existing exports are correct.
  - [ ] Add specific exports from subdirectories (`./events/EventTypes`, `./resources/ResourceTypes`, etc.) if they are needed globally across the application.
  - [ ] Consider creating `index.ts` barrel files within subdirectories if not already present.
- [ ] **Task N3: Refine `src/config/game/gameConfig.ts`**
  - [ ] Update placeholder values to match actual game balance and settings.
  - [ ] Define a proper `interface GameConfig` (potentially in `src/types/config/`) and apply it.
  - [ ] Ensure all necessary configuration options used elsewhere in the game are present.
- [ ] **Task N4: Refine `src/lib/ai/behaviorTree.ts`**
  - [ ] Implement concrete `ActionNode` subclasses for specific game actions (e.g., `MoveToTarget`, `AttackEnemy`, `GatherResource`).
  - [ ] Implement concrete `ConditionNode` subclasses for game state checks (e.g., `IsTargetInRange`, `HasLowHealth`, `ResourceAvailable`).
  - [ ] Add more `DecoratorNode` types if needed (e.g., `Succeeder`, `Repeater`, `RateLimiter`).
  - [ ] Integrate the `Blackboard` with actual game state information (entity properties, target data, etc.).
- [ ] **Task N5: Refine `src/pages/ConverterManagementPage.tsx`**
  - [ ] Import and use the actual `ResourceConversionManager` via the Manager Registry (`ManagerRegistry.ts`).
  - [ ] Replace `unknown[]` state with the correct type for converters.
  - [ ] Implement the actual data fetching logic in `loadConverters` using the manager.
  - [ ] Replace placeholder UI elements (divs, buttons) with actual UI components from your design system (e.g., `Card`, `Button`, `Typography`).
  - [ ] Implement the `ConverterDashboard` or equivalent list component.
  - [ ] Implement the `ConverterDetailsView` component.
  - [ ] Implement functionality for `handleCreateConverter`, delete, configure, etc.
- [ ] **Task N6: Codebase Integration and Verification**
  - [ ] Search the codebase for any potential errors caused by the missing files (e.g., broken imports, type errors).
  - [ ] Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and linters (`eslint`) to identify and fix errors related to these files.
  - [ ] Test the relevant parts of the application (AI behavior, game configuration loading, converter management UI) to ensure functionality is restored.
