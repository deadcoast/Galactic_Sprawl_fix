# Optimized AI Prompting Framework

Here's an optimized version of your prompts, designed to be more concise and effective while introducing enhanced methods for better results.

## 1. Codebase Initialization

```
Review the @.cursorrules file completely. This defines our core workflow and MUST be strictly followed. Populate System Documents (@CodeBase_Docs/System_Integration.md and @CodeBase_Docs/System_Architecture.md) with specific contextual details from our codebase. Transform these from generic specifications into codebase-specific documentation while preserving all workflow components for future implementation compatibility.
```

## 2. Documentation Utilization

```
Refer to @.cursorrules for workflow procedures. Leverage comprehensive documentation in @.cursorcontext and directory tree in @.cursortree for proper codebase integration.
```

## 3. Duplicate Code Analysis

```
Analyze @.cursortree . Systematically search the entire codebase for duplicated files, proceeding directory-by-directory. Document all findings in @.cursorcontext following the clear organization format with appropriate context.
```

## 4. Error Correction Framework

```
1. Examine errors comprehensively
2. Resolve syntax issues in affected files
3. Update TypeScript configuration appropriately
Include specific error details in your response for targeted resolution.
```

## 5. Resource Module Standardization

```
Adhere to @.cursorrules.md workflow. Create a structured scratchpad tasklist for Resource modules. Focus on correcting linting errors and ensuring type consistency. Convert string literals to enumerated types throughout the resource system.
```

## 6. Context Building

```
Following @.cursorrules workflow, analyze files in the `Tasklist` and populate the @.cursorcontext.md document. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically.
```

```
Following @.cursorrules workflow, analyze files in the `Tasklist` and populate the @.cursortemp.md document. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically.
```

## 7. Comprehensive Documentation Completion

```
Cross-reference @.cursortree.md against @.cursorcontext.md. Identify documentation gaps by searching for "##" and "###" section markers. Create a prioritized tasklist to implement missing sections in the context document. Focus on most critical components first. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically. When the `Tasklist` is updated, we will add new content to @.cursortemp file, and the user will export it to its proper section.

**NOTE**: YOU ARE EDITING A LIVING FILE, SOME ASPECTS OF THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDED. YOU MUST ALWAYS CHECK YOUR INTEGRATIONS FOR DUPLICATIONS. CRITICAL: VERIFY INTEGRATIONS AND ADDITIONS ARE NOT DUPLICATES.
