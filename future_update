2. Core Faction Implementation
   [ ] Space Rats (Pirates)
      - Always hostile behavior
      - Aggressive patrol routines
      - 10 ship classes implementation
   [ ] Lost Nova (Exiles)
      - Reactive behavior
      - Stealth and ambush tactics
      - 10 ship classes implementation
   [ ] Equator Horizon (Ancient)
      - Conditional appearance
      - Balance enforcer behavior
      - 10 ship classes implementation

2. Behavior System Components
   [ ] Faction State Management
      - Territory control
      - Fleet strength calculation
      - Relationship tracking
   [ ] AI Decision Making
      - Behavior trees
      - State machines
      - Combat tactics
   [ ] Spawning System
      - Triggered spawning
      - Random encounters
      - Pre-occupied systems

3. Integration Steps
   [ ] Update useFactionBehavior.ts
      - Add faction-specific interfaces
      - Implement behavior calculation
      - Add territory management
   [ ] Combat System Integration
      - Weapon systems
      - Ship prefabs
      - Combat automation
   [ ] Visual Feedback
      - Territory indicators
      - Combat status
      - Alert system

### Implementation Order:
1. First implement core faction interfaces and types
2. Then add faction-specific behavior calculations
3. Integrate with existing combat and ship systems
4. Add visual feedback and monitoring systems

### Tech Requirements:
- Use XState for state machines
- Implement behavior trees
- Integrate with existing combat manager
- Use RxJS for event streams
