## Architecture Assessment

### Component Structure
The codebase is organized into the following main components:
- **src/** - Main source code directory
  - **components/** - UI components
  - **contexts/** - React context providers
  - **hooks/** - Custom React hooks
  - **lib/** - Core libraries and utilities
  - **managers/** - Business logic managers
  - **services/** - Service implementations
  - **types/** - TypeScript type definitions
  - **utils/** - Utility functions

### Flow Diagrams
Key data and control flows:
```
[User Interface] → [Components] → [Contexts/Hooks] → [Managers] → [Services]
                                                  ↑           ↓
                                        [Types] → [Utils] ← [Lib]
```

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Address linting errors, especially those related to type safety
2. Resolve duplicate code patterns
3. Update outdated dependencies

### Medium Priority
1. Improve test coverage
2. Refactor complex components
3. Standardize error handling across the codebase

### Low Priority
1. Enhance documentation
2. Optimize build configuration
3. Add performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The {{PROJECT_NAME}} codebase shows good organization but would benefit from addressing the issues identified in this report. Focusing on the high-priority recommendations will improve code quality and maintainability.
