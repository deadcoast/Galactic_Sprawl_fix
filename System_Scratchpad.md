## Implementation Progress

We've made significant progress in enhancing the Data Analysis System with the implementation of two key services:

1. **DataCollectionService**: This service improves the data collection pipeline by:

   - Subscribing to exploration events (sector discovery, scanning, anomaly detection, resource detection)
   - Preprocessing data into a standardized format for analysis
   - Providing filtering capabilities for refined data selection
   - Implementing caching to improve performance

2. **AnalysisAlgorithmService**: This service enhances the analysis capabilities by:

   - Implementing various analysis algorithms (trend, correlation, distribution)
   - Processing datasets with advanced statistical methods
   - Generating insights from data patterns
   - Caching expensive calculations for better performance

3. **Enhanced DataAnalysisContext**: We've integrated both services into the context to:

   - Provide seamless access to collected data
   - Run analyses more effectively
   - Refresh data from the collection service
   - Apply filters for refined analysis

4. **Improved UI Components**: We've created several new components to enhance the user experience:
   - DatasetManager: For creating and managing datasets
   - AnalysisConfigManager: For creating and managing analysis configurations
   - DataFilterPanel: For filtering data based on various criteria
   - ResultsPanel: For viewing analysis results in a user-friendly format

## Current Challenges

### Dependency Issues

Several components have dependency issues, particularly with Material UI imports. These need to be resolved to ensure proper component rendering.

### Type Consistency

While we've created type definitions, there are still inconsistencies and 'any' types that should be removed for better type safety.

### Integration Gaps

The front-end components and back-end services need better integration points to ensure data flows properly through the system.

## Next Steps

The priority tasks now focus on:

1. Resolving dependency issues and ensuring proper integration between components
2. Implementing advanced chart visualizations for better data representation
3. Completing the implementation of advanced analysis types like clustering and prediction
4. Ensuring type consistency and removing any remaining 'any' types
5. Optimizing performance for large datasets

These enhancements will significantly improve the data analysis capabilities of the system, providing users with powerful tools to gain insights from exploration data.
