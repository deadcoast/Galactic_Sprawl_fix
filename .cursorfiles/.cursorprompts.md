# Optimized AI Prompting Framework

## 1. Codebase Initialization

Review the @.cursorrules file completely. This defines our core workflow and MUST be strictly followed. Populate System Documents (@CodeBase_Docs/System_Integration.md and @CodeBase_Docs/System_Architecture.md) with specific contextual details from our codebase. Transform these from generic specifications into codebase-specific documentation while preserving all workflow components for future implementation compatibility.

## 2. Documentation Utilization

Refer to @.cursorrules for workflow procedures. Leverage comprehensive documentation in @.cursorcontext and directory tree in @.cursortree for proper codebase integration.

## 3. Duplicate Code Analysis

Analyze @.cursortree . Systematically search the entire codebase for duplicated files, proceeding directory-by-directory. Document all findings in @.cursorcontext following the clear organization format with appropriate context.

## 4. Error Correction Framework

1. Examine errors comprehensively
2. Resolve syntax issues in affected files
3. Update TypeScript configuration appropriately
Include specific error details in your response for targeted resolution.

## 5. Resource Module Standardization

Adhere to @.cursorrules.md workflow. Create a structured scratchpad tasklist for Resource modules. Focus on correcting linting errors and ensuring type consistency. Convert string literals to enumerated types throughout the resource system.

## 6. Context Building

Following @.cursorrules workflow, analyze files in the `Tasklist` and populate the @.cursorcontext.md document. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically.

Following @.cursorrules workflow, analyze files in the `Tasklist` and populate the @.cursortemp.md document. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically.

## 7. Comprehensive Documentation Completion

Cross-reference @.cursortree.md against @.cursorcontext.md. Identify documentation gaps by searching for "##" and "###" section markers. Create a prioritized tasklist to implement missing sections in the context document. Focus on most critical components first. CRITICAL: Extract context from BOTH actual code files/functions and the relevant @CodeBase_Docs . Verify all context against source code. This task requires detailed analysis - proceed methodically. When the `Tasklist` is updated, we will add new content to @.cursortemp file, and the user will export it to its proper section.

**NOTE**: YOU ARE EDITING A LIVING FILE, SOME ASPECTS OF THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDED. YOU MUST ALWAYS CHECK YOUR INTEGRATIONS FOR DUPLICATIONS. CRITICAL: VERIFY INTEGRATIONS AND ADDITIONS ARE NOT DUPLICATES.

## 8. Context Extraction Workflow

- **REVIEW THE `/Users/deadcoast/CursorProjects/Galactic_Sprawl/CodeBase_Docs` AND THE RELEVANT CODE FILES IN `src`. COMPLETE THE CONTEXT EXTRACTIONS FOR `.cursorcontext` STEP BY STEP.**

- _THIS WORKFLOW MUST BE COMPLETED WITH CONTEXT AS TOP PRIORITY._

1. Search the relevant DOCS.
2. Search for the relevant typescript or tsx files
3. Extract the context from both 1 and 2.
4. Export the context into the proper `#hashtag` section <in@.cursorcontext.md>
5. **NOTE:** _VERY IMPORTANT_ - ENSURE THAT YOUR ITEGRATION IS NOT A DUPLICATION. CREATING DUPLICATIONS DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

## 9. Error Corrections

YOU MUST FOLLOW THE WORKFLOW IN @.cursorrules , I HAVE ATTACHED CONTEXTUAL FILES. YOU MUST USE THEM AS PER YOUR WORKFLOW. Begin correcting and integrating any required functions from the Scratchpad Tasklist. THIS CODE BASE IN UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. DO NOT REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT UNUSED VARIABLES. WE ARE IN THE STEP OF INTEGRATING THEM NOW. Use sequentialthinking to complete the taskslists.
